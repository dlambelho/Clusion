Sumac is not in every kitchen cupboard, but it should be.  A lot like lemon, tart and astringent, but somehow moreso, it brings out other flavors and enhances them. Makes them more intense.  Sprinkle equal parts sumac, thyme and salt (the blend is called zaatar and used a lot in middle eastern cooking) on chicken before roasting and broiling and it brings out all the chicken flavor with just a hint of tanginess.<br /><br />One half a teaspoon sprinkled on scrambled eggs lifts them out of the category of breakfast standby and into a completely new echelon.  The pairing of smoked fish (lox or salmon, whitefish, sable or, especially, sturgeon) with sumac-enhanced scrambled eggs does things to the inside of the mouth that are probably illegal in some Red States.<br /><br />Run of the mill red caviar can be mixed with sour cream, a tiny amount of finely chopped chives and a big hit of sumac, then spread on a halved fingerling potatoes that have been sliced in half, drizzled with lots of olive oil and oven roasted until they have a good, crunchy crust. It's a combination of flavors and textures that's explodes with bright flavor. If you can never get too much salt, scatter some crisp bacon on top.  It's really salty, but really delicious.<br /><br />Any food that benefits from a squirt of lemon will be better with a little sumac.  Even lemonade is improved, especially if your lemons are dull and you want a really tart beverage.  Melt 1/2 cup sugar in hot water, pour it into a big pitcher. Add one teaspoon sumac, 1/4 tsp vanilla (super secret ingredient, tell no one), the juice of 4 lemons (don't squeeze too hard, you don't want sour oils from the skin ruining the taste), and enough filtered walter to fill up the pitcher. Chill and you have the iconic summer afternoon drink.<br /><br />Sumac is perfect with fish.  Sumac and ginger rubbed onto any white fish bring out the sweetness...this is especially lovely on catfish or those new fish like tilapia that have started appearing in the markets as the really good fish disappear or become too expensive.  Sumac and garlic are a brawnier pairing, good with fish, great with vegetables.  Sautee broccoli or spinach in olive oil with garlic, then sprinkle with sumac. Even veggie haters will think twice before saying no.  And added to home fries, sumac transforms diner food into something you'll want to serve with an expensive steak.  You can also rub sumac on steak to brighten the taste or add it to your usual dry rub or marinade.  And try it in chicken soup.  Just trust me on that one...you will want to throw a parade for me after tasting.  Experiment. Keep some in a dish on the table and sprinkle wherever you might have added lemon...on salads, in salad dressings for more that sharp lemony taste but less acid.<br /><br />If you need a quick lunch, salad or appetizer, this is a fast and easy go-to dish that takes five minutes to make and will please even people who (like me) consider salads more decorative than edible.  And if someone you invite to dinner sits down at the table and drops the bomb: "But didn't you know I'm a vegan?" you can dash to the kitchen and have it ready to slide under that persnicity little snoot in two minutes.<br /><br />Spiced Tomatoes on Exotic Bread<br />2 Tablespoons dried thyme<br />1 Tablespoon sumac<br />2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted<br />1/2 teaspoon table salt<br />1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (or regular if you don't have the little ones. Why sweat the small stuff)<br /><br />In a small container with a lid, shake together the zaatar...thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt. If you don't have sesame seeds, it's okay. It will still taste good, just not as good.  The combination, with or without the seeds is called 'zaatar,' which is Arabic for "Can I have some more, please."<br /><br />Cut each of the cherry tomatoes in half (if using whole tomatoes, dice them and let a little of the juice drain away, you don't want this too liquidy), sprinkle with about one tablespoon of the zaatar.  Stir it all together, then taste. You don't want it too salty.  Add more zaatar if necessary, tasting as you go.  The tomatoes will make this very juicy. Serve with lots of toasted naan, pita, lavash, or any middle eastern flatbread that's fun to dip/sop.  I've served it with corn tortillas and it was good. I think it would be great with toasted french bread or garlic bread.  It is so good, you forget it's made of vegetables.<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute: I forgot tunafish.  One can of tuna, one tablespoon each mayo and plain yogurt (please, not that scary plastic looking non fat stuff, use the real thing). One big tablespoon of sumac. Stir lightly so the tuna stays lumpy. Pile it on top of toasted rye bread or a rye krisp, open-faced, and scatter chives on top.  It's just tuna, takes no more time than the same old same old, but it tastes much better, plus it's festive.<br /><br />Enjoy.
