This is my story... Maybe a little long, but it was hard to me to spend time (away from screaming child) to looking for such information.<br /><br />My baby is almost 3 months. I BF him but supplement with formula. We started with Similac Advance because my sister brought to me one can before i gave a birth. . After about 3 weeks, my son started has a problems with digesting. It was terrible to watch him how he is pushing and crying almost 24 hours a day. Certainly, it was not because of BF, so I decided to change the formula and our doctor gave me Nutramegin Lipil and Good Start Protective and told me that it has easy-to-digest protein, so I gave it to try. My baby hated Nutramegin immediately! He kicked the bottle over the room by one hand ))) My mom told me: "Don't worry! The baby will use to it". I think that word "use to it" suppose to use when baby, for example, has a diagnose (real allergy or something else medical), so the way the baby like or dislike some kind of formula doesn't matter because he/she needs (must) to eat it. Today the Nutramegin Lipil is not exist because they improved the formula by adding new addition like Enflora, which my baby doesn't accept.<br /><br />I came back to Similac brand, trying to switch among types of one brand. Thinking, that maybe my babe allergic to lactose, I switched to Similac Alimentum. As the result, my baby liked it immediately, but he started eat more like he was hungry every time. For example, usual portion at one time was 4 oz and after introducing him new formula, it became 7-8 oz. And he was attract to this formula like a bee to honey.<br /><br />I couldn't experiment my baby anymore and I went for just information for all formulas and look what I found.<br /><br />There is 3 main formula on the market - Similac, Enfamil and Nestle Good Start. Of course, there more brands of infant formula, but these are often to use by all medical facilities.<br />All infant formulas are prepared according to FDA regulations which 'specify minimum and, in some cases, maximum nutrient level requirements for infant formulas.<br />There is no word that one brand better than another, just says that low iron formula should not be used.<br />Infant formulas mostly differ in the type of sugar and protein that they have.<br />Regular iron fortified infant formulas, such as Similac Advance, Enfamil Lipil, and Nestle Good Start Supreme are made with lactose and cow's milk based proteins. Most infants who are not breastfeeding exclusively should be given a cow's milk based iron fortified formula.<br />Soy formulas are made with soy protein and are lactose free. They are good for children who don't tolerate lactose or milk proteins.<br />Elemental formulas are also lactose free and are made with hydrolysate proteins, which are easy to digest for infants with protein allergies. Types of elemental formulas include Nutramigen, Pregestamil and Alimentum.<br />If you have a family history of food allergies or formula intolerances, you might choose to start your baby off with a soy or elemental formula if you do not want to breastfeed.<br />Lactose free formulas are made without lactose, but do have cow's milk proteins in them. Infants are not usually thought to be born with a lactose intolerance, so these formulas are usually not needed.<br />Other infant formulas include Enfamil AR (added rice), which is supposed to be helpful for infants with reflux and premature formulas, such as Similac Special Care and Enfamil Premature.<br /><br />So. My family and family of my husband don't have a history of any allergies. My baby suppose to be able to drink regular formula or easy to digest, but based on cow milk, not soy.<br />If Infants are not usually born with lactose intolerance, so my baby also should drink a formula with lactose not sugar.<br /><br />Most of Similac easy to digest formulas includes sugar not lactose, exclude regular "blue", which my son doesn't accept. Also, Similac and Enfamil brands have so many(!) different types of formula that it easily be lost there )))<br /><br />Good Start has only 3 types excluding 2nd stage: Protective (regular), Gentle Plus (gentle itself) and Soy. That is all! Very simple and smart! Protective and Gentle Plus so much similar that if you accidentally switched it...nothing will happen.<br />Good Start formula based on whey protein concentrate (from cow's milk) and with lactose, not sugar.<br />In the beginning, the formula made with easy-to-digest proteins, they called comfort proteins. I agree with some of the reviewer that these words suppose to be on the front of all cans and in big letters.<br />I found nothing compare to this formula among main formulas on the market.<br />I found one negative review about formula itself and few reviews about the price. If your child drinks Similac Alimentum, for example, or Nutramegin Lipil, then the price is very similar to Good Start, but what a difference - those two are for allergy and, with sugar and Good Start is just regular main formula. That's why I don't understand Why people gave only one star to a product if there is no explanation about the product itself?<br />One woman said that the color of poop ))) was green and because of that the formula is bad. It's not true. That woman wasn't patient with the time. She didn't gave her child to normalize baby's system due to introducing new formula (24 -36 hours).<br />Also, the Good Start by Nestle joined the Gerber and Gerber company is THE NAME. You can easily see their name on all infant and toddler food, clothes and accessories in most malls and stores around the country. Gerber is also produce the special water for mixing with formula. The Nestle company itself is also producing many products for kids.<br />If the store has sale or deals on baby's formula, the first formula which gone in seconds is Good Start.<br /><br />Now, my son is absolutely normal boy without any allergies. He sleeps well and eat with pleasure.
