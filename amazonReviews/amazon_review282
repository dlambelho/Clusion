Chomped one down as soon as the pack arrived. First impressions: 'Way gooey but probably had been subjected to excess heat in PO truck. Salt dominates compared to other bars I've had that call themselves sweet and salty, which flavor combo I have liked very much but is not present in this bar. Dense and filling - satisfying - for its size.<br /><br />Above all, anything that takes the time and effort to be and label itself Gluten Free gets a huge thumbs-up from me. Statisticians used to think about 1 in 250 in the US could not tolerate wheat or gluten; today's estimate is more like 1 in 100 as physicians are starting to think outside the boxes into which they were trained, and are recognizing celiac disease and/or wheat allergy as the causes of persistent, hard-to-diagnose intestinal problems sometimes presenting as late as the sixth or seventh decade of life.<br /><br />There is one small glitch here, not sure how small a glitch. These bars are clearly labelled Gluten Free but there is also a statement, "This product is produced in a facility that also processes soy, milk, egg, wheat, peanuts, sesame, tree nuts." This statement does not mean that the product is MADE ON machinery on which wheat has been processed, and then reused to produce these. (Even if that were the case, thorough cleaning should eliminate gluten.) But after I ate the first bar, I had the typical celiac reaction and couldn't figure out what I had done wrong, as I had not ingested anything with gluten. And I confess I didn't suspect this product. I waited 5 days and ate another bar. Bingo. Within 24 hours I again had that unpleasant intestinal reaction, and it was preceded by the painful gut-rumbling and feeling of pressure that always happen when I ingest gluten.<br /><br />Now it happens that I have enough scientific training to know that neither of these incidents proves causal relationship between ingestion and reaction. But it certainly has my eyebrows raised, and should make you wonder, too. An accidental ingestion of gluten is not fatal to the celiac but long-term it produces damage and short-term it is a real nuisance. I'm not providing all the graphic details of what happens to me.<br /><br />So back to the goo issue. I had put the remaining bars in the fridge. Yes, the second one, several days later, was far less gooey. But still, a lot of goo remained on the wrapper. (Would it get there if not exposed to heat? Dunno.) To me, that brings up two problems. First, my basic use for snack bars is to keep from getting too hungry while driving, so they get kept in the vehicle. Any crumbs that fall are going to be nasty cuz they are sticky as opposed to dry-crumby which I can vacuum out easily. I did note that not too many crumbs fell.<br /><br />Second, sticky-wrapper disposal can be tricky and requires special attention. These are far more likely to attract vermin and again, stick to things and leave a residue I don't want. A sticky piece of wrapper just fell and disappeared as I was writing this review. It took some contortions and a flashlight to retrieve it but retrieve it I must or attract mice to my computer station. Speaking of mice, I now have to go get a wash cloth to get the stickiness from my fingers off the computer mouse.<br /><br />About the flavor, well, I was thinking that they might be ideal when I want a salt fix as opposed to a sugar fix. A close friend used to say that he thought I would eat hay if I thought it was good for me. Yes, I'm like that (snorts and whinnys). But these taste less like hay, more like cardboard.<br /><br />UPDATE, a year later: I stuck the box of these bars in the fridge and every once in a while when I have had the energy to tackle something difficult, I've eaten one. The jury is still out on the gluten issue - sometimes I've not had the gluten reaction. But I am even more firmly convinced that when a product is labelled "Gluten Free", that it should in fact be gluten free. Not just "maybe" like these. I mean really, it makes me wonder what part of allergic, etc. some people don't understand.<br /><br />The stickiness and hardness continue to be problems making enjoyment difficult but perhaps I've gotten used to that, expect it. Over time I have come to like the mildly sweet/salt taste better. Although I'm not totally thrilled with taste or texture, I have moved my rating from two stars to four.<br /><br />Thanks to the manufacturer for sending a whole box rather than just the single so often sent to Vine reviewers - I needed more in order to do a thorough review.
