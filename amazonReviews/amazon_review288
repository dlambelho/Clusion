After spending significant money on Thai Iced Tea in restaurants, I went on a quest to make it at home.  In this review, I hope to not only review this product but share what I learned in my process to duplicate what I was getting from Thai restaurants.<br /><br />Instead of buying the Pantai Thai Tea Mix (the item this review is tagged to) I bought it at my local chain Asian market for $3.99.  The only ingredients listed were green tea and yellow dye No.6.  I have 2 problems with this: 1. Everything I have read to date uses black tea, not green.  2. That can't be all that's in it as visual inspection shows at least 2 other unidentifiable bits that do NOT look like tea.  I would have thought they were spices commonly found in Thai tea (like all spice or clove, or star anise) however the "bits" do not look, taste or smell like any of those.<br /><br />The actual amount of teas leaves in the mix is pretty low.  There are lots of "woody" bits, as if they ground up a tea plant rather than using just the tea leaves.  That would explain why when I brewed it, it gave off a wood resin like smell and has a woody, astringent after taste.  Which makes me wonder, what kind of tea plant did they use? Was it laden with pesticides?  Sure tasted like it might.  Even after I steeped a cardamom pod in it, added vanilla and orange flower water, the overriding flavor was still woody.<br /><br />[Note: I had the same results from another brand I bought at the Asian market called "Taste Nirvana Tisanes Thai Tea."  It comes in tea bags, needs augmenting with additional spices and also has an "off taste]<br /><br />The only thing this tea mix has going for it, is that the color comes out the same as the restaurants - thanks to the food coloring.  Which leads me to what I want to share from my quest for make it at home Thai tea.<br /><br />- If you want the orange color, its going to have to come from food coloring.  I've tried finding some special "red" tea that hails from Thailand and there is no such thing.  There's other "red" teas in the world, but they don't hail from Thailand.  I'm not doubting there may be something special about black tea leaves grown in Thailand but it certainly doesn't impart the bright orange on its own.<br />- You can choose between presentation or flavor and maybe possibly both.  If you want to "float" the milk on top like the restaurants do, DON'T use condensed milk.  Instead, sweeten the tea so it will be denser that the evaporated milk and the milk will float on top.  (Note: I didn't try half in half).  If you don't care about presentation, you can save a step by using sweetened condensed milk and the unsweetened tea.<br />- Some parts of Thailand use coconut milk.  I tried - it was very tasty. (but not in the gross mix I'm reviewing)<br />- The black tea alone will not give you the flavor you want.  You have to steep with spices too.  The most accurate recipe I have found thus far is this:<br />1 gallon water<br />8 Chinese star anise, ground<br />1 tablespoon orange flowers (I used orange flower water)<br />1 tablespoon powdered vanilla (or steep a piece of vanilla bean cut lengthwise)<br />1 pinch of clove powder<br />1 pinch chopped cinnamon<br />3/4 quart long cut China black tea leaves<br />1 to 2 cups sugar<br />1 quart half & half (I used evaporated milk)<br />red food coloring<br />[go online and Wiki Thai tea and there's a link to the directions]<br /><br />If you want something faster than this recipe.  Here's best alternative I have found that yields great flavor but not the bright orange color.  Bought Yogi brand++ Sweet Thai Delight (tea bags) and steep one bag in 6 oz hot water for 5 minutes.  Add a heaping tablespoon of sugar and stir to dissolve.  Then let cool completely or stick in fridge until cold.  Pour over ice, then top with evaporated milk.  OR, skip the sugar and evaporated milk and add sweetened condensed milk when hot, then cool and pour over milk.  *I add a dash of orange flower water, dash of ground cardamom and real vanilla extract and it really makes this good.<br /><br />I'm going to try making my own pre-mix by grinding in a coffee burr grinder all the spices and bulk tea leaves from the above recipe and storing.  Then I'll just brew it up in the coffee maker and chill overnight.  Wish me luck!<br /><br />++I like the fact the Yogi brand is certified organic, so I know I'm not getting nasty pesticides there.  So all that's left is the other stuff that I control what's in it - I like that option.
