CLAXTON FRUIT CAKE (3lb.) AMAZON REVIEW<br /><br />Credit cards are weird.  I mean, you wann 'em, and if you play your cards right over time, you gott 'em. But ahh, the catch.  If you don't use 'em, you might just lose 'em.  What's all of this have to do with fruitcake?  Well, sans any fruitcake jokes, please stand by...<br /><br />Recently, I've lost a couple of hard-earned credit cards, due to "lack of use."  Really?  I mean, really?!!  Is this what America has come down to?  I do all I can to establish or re-establish my basic U.S. dollar, human worthiness for unsolicited credit card offers, only to get a few, only to lose out when I don't use them for awhile?  Without warning.  ZAP!  They're gone.  Seems "they" want you to have the cards, but if you go overboard with them, they hound you to no end, but then, if you don't use them, or even forget you had one, they cut you off and cancel your card.  Fruitcake, I say!  Fruitcake!<br /><br />So it was, after I learned these things and more, that I told myself, with one card, hey, I better USE this or LOSE it.  Having nothing really I wanted or needed at the time (all you NEED is love...), I ordered this product from Amazon.  Through one of those cards I feared losing soon, unless I used it.  But after ordering, receiving, and trying this particular product (some supposed "gourmet" fruitcake), I can only report that this was/isss overall, much less than I expected.  In other words, this is pretty bad fruitcake, in my opinion, and for the price, really bad.  If you are at all in my situation, I strongly suggest that you use any under-used credit card funds or other "disposable income" on something else.  Cause this is pretty bad fruitcake.<br /><br />Now, before you cut me to the quick, and question either/or my knowledge and experience of/with said fruitcake product, let me just say that I've been getting fruitcakes as gifts (usually around Christmas), for a long, long, long, long time.  Ever since I care to remember actually.  I think I remember that once upon a time, I casually mentioned to family, friends, or others, that I liked fruitcake.  I actually, generally LIKED fruitcake.  Well, soon the word spread, and I've been given them by family, friends, or other over the ages.  Not that I'm complaining, because I DO LIKE FRUITCAKE!  There, I said it all.  But...this particular fruitcake brand?  Fairly average at best, but compared to the cost, pretty awful.<br /><br />Oh, believe me dear readers and followers, I WANTED to like this.  I really did.  An impulse buy at the time, all I wanted really was some half-decent fruitcake and an inexpensive means to keeping a credit card alive and kicking.  Well, big, impulsive mistake, because, according to my taste, and my own decades-long relationship with fruitcakes in general, this is not very good.  And it is only my history of loving almost EVERY fruitcake I've ever had, which guides to you, my fellow fruitcake lover, away from buying anything more than a sample of this product.  And please don't make the mistake I made when I ordered taste-unseen, three single fruitcakes, when the purchase of even one would've told me the story here.<br /><br />I realize with this review that I may go against the grain (though not fiber-wise) in dissing this, but I'm just coming from a long history of fruitcake enjoyment and this doesn't even come close in quality, taste, and otherwise, to fruitcakes enjoyed past, present, and future.  Heck, this isn't even "cake" at all.  It's like this big, thick, DOUGH, with TOO many TOO sweet "fruits," and the nuts were pretty dry and unmemorable.  Heck, I don't even LIKE sweets generally.  I'd much rather have a bowl of cheese crackers or chips than a bowl full of M&M's or Reese's peanut butter cups or chunkey monkey or any other such sickenly sweet thing.  But heck, just about the ONLY sweet I've ever really loved, was/is fruitcake.  So, why was/is this so disappointing, and so overpriced?<br /><br />I think this is the fruitcake equivalent of fruitcake DOUGH.  Like cookie-dough ice-cream, which I've always thought too weird and not really concentrating on the essentials.  This is like eating fruitcake DOUGH, before any baking.  And that, ain't good.  Fruitcake should be CAKE, not uncooked DOUGH.  And that's what this is really.  In the end, wholly unacceptable, and to go technical on you'all, pretty darn yucky, you betcha!  Only my opinion...try a sample before ordering anything more than that.<br /><br />Judging by the generally favorable opinions about this specific fruitcake I've found here on Amazon, I may never know if this is just me, or what.  This has generally high reviews, but I only managed to finish ONE of the THREE individual pounds I ordered and was sent (and btw, Amazon delivered nice and fast and easy as usual), and was just gonna GIVE the rest away, but I think I would've felt guilty about subjecting anyone else to this, so I just threw the other two pound "cakes" away.  Maybe the rats or worms will like it, I don't know.<br /><br />Basically, to make a long, boring, but hopefully humorous story short, I suggest buyer beware on this, and buy/try the smallest portion/size you can.  If you like this thick, tasteless in many ways, un-fruitcake, by all means, purchase away.  But I can't give this any kind of enthusiastic thumbs up, as far as fruitcakes go.  And wouldn't ya know it, the instructions for use are virtually non-existent, with no manual, no software, and little documentation as to why and how I'm supposed to actually enjoy this doughy mess.  And no real warranty!  Fruitcake lover/buyer beware...<br /><br />To all fellow outcast, strange dog, hopelessly romantic, secret fruitcake lovers, my small minority brothers and sisters who KNOW good fruitcake from bad, let me just say that this is nowhere near worth the asking price.  To those of you who've tried this and actually liked it, I can only suggest you expand your fruitcake worldview and experience to other brands because this just ain't that good.  A cheap dollar store variety is better than this, IMHO.  One thing for sure though, next hardly used credit card purchase goes to another gift card for someone else, for something other than such a bad product as bad as this...
