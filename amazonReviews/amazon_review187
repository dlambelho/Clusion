I don't quite understand this product.<br /><br />The product at my kitchen temperature consists of a large and pretty sincerely solid solid on the bottom of the jar and an oil on top.  You may use either substance by itself, but if you want to use the product as designed you should mix the solid and the liquid together so that any cc is the same viscosity and has the same ratio of ingredients and as any other cc.<br /><br />The solid really is, and until it's liquefied you can't use the product.<br /><br />According to the Amazon description page, which is no doubt what many people will rely on in deciding whether to buy this product, "To liquify [sic], place jar in hot water for 2 minutes and stir."  I don't know exactly what the term "hot water" means, but unless it means more than boiling (which is impossible except in a sealed vessel such as a pressure cooker), this won't work.  Not after two minutes and not after twice that again.  Unless they're talking about two minutes on Pluto, whose day is 6 Earth days plus 9 hours, which is 6.375 times longer, which when multiplied by 2 minutes is 12 Earth minutes plus 45 seconds, which would make more sense (except for the Pluto part).<br /><br />The Nutiva Web site says you can melt it by placing it in a hot but not boiling water bath for -- and you'll see I'm quoting here -- "a few moments."  I don't know about you, but to me "a few moments" is significantly less than the two minutes we already know is more than a little bit too little.  And don't forget that to those few moments you have to add the time it takes to gather a heat-proof vessel and water and turn on the stove and then wait for the water to heat up.  Not to mention the expense, however little, of producing that heat and buying that water.  Not to mention having to remember to turn off that heat source.  Not to mention washing however sincerely you want to that heating vessel, after you've waited for it cool down sufficiently, and then drying it and returning it whence it came.<br /><br />Sheeesh.<br /><br />The texture of the properly mixed substance -- a colloid suspension that must eventually separate, if I'm not mistaken -- when eaten plain from a spoon or the superior end of someone's superior natal cleft is not what I expected, being more gritty like wasabi than velvety like the inside part of good caviar.  Still, like wasabi it's not designed to be licked from a spoon like ice cream, so I subtract no stars for this.<br /><br />Nutiva Organic Coconut Manna, 15-Ounce (Pack of 2) seems to me like quite a specialty product, almost a novelty, which is why I said I don't quite understand it.  In order to add it to "smoothies, sauces, and dressings" or to use it in any other way, according to the manufacturer you start by liquefying it in a hot water bath and then mixing it.  This makes it quite different from, say, apple butter, which you just open the jar of and out of from which you dip or pour some.<br /><br />So many other similar foods require less effort and certainly less time, such as margarine and honey.<br /><br />And this product, when used as recommended by the manufacturer, requires at least that you have a heating vessel and water and a source of heat, so you probably won't want to take it on a picnic or to the local swimming hole.  So many other similar foods require no additional parts except maybe a spoon, such as ranch dressing and yogurt and orange marmalade.  And they don't require mixing.<br /><br />For the inconvenience, which makes it less likely I will use the product even if I knew the best way to use it, I subtract two stars.<br /><br />The Amazon description page says, "Coconut Manna will delight people looking for coconut butter, coconut cream, coconut oil butter and coconut body butter."  If by coconut body butter is meant a substance you would slather all over your body for some reason, I will not be reporting on that particular use for this review.  Ever.<br /><br />Those of you who've read a few of my recent reviews will not be surprised to learn that I did experiment with some more off-label uses, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- You should not expect this food to be a good substitute for the butter in Alfredo sauce or for the egg whites in a meringue.<br /><br />-- You should not paint your house with this food unless you really, really like lots more local wildlife than you ever knew existed.  You should use real paint.<br /><br />-- This product is an utter failure as a substitute for parakeet shampoo.  You should use real parakeet shampoo.<br /><br />-- As a shaving cream it sucks hard unless you like many small lacerations on your face.  You should use real shaving cream.<br /><br />-- It makes for a terrible antibiotic ointment for many small lacerations on your face unless you like many pusillanimous and mephitic infections on your face.  Speaking strictly for myself here, as it turns out I do not.<br /><br />In case you're wondering, despite all the failures in the bulleted list just above I subtract no further stars.
