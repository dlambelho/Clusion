I've tried to write this review three times now, and every time I get a power blip or something happens to the browser and I lose it.  One more time.<br /><br />I made this carefully, and it is not tasty.  It has a big packet of spices that has a lot of whey, onion, and cheese and spices like black pepper are lower than an ingredient that is listed as "not more than 2%.<br /><br />I've eaten tasty mac and cheese, and I've even eaten decent hamburger helper, like <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ59EQ">Hamburger Helper, Cheesy Nacho, 7.9-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  That stuff is cheaper and tastes better.<br /><br />This stuff is easy to make.  You brown one pound of beef (I weighed it to be sure I was following directions) and then drain it (pouring out the tasty juices, I won't do that again), then add the misnamed seasoning packet and the pasta, along with two cups of water.<br /><br />Bring it to a boil, reduce heat, cover, and cook for 11-13 minutes.<br /><br />Then remove from the heat and mix in the velveeta packet.<br /><br />They suggest that you add lettuce?  Or chopped tomatoes, so I added Ro-Tel to part of it - the other part I kept pristine so that I could taste it as made.  I used hot Ro-Tel, and, other than the flavor of the Ro-Tel it was bland.  I have to think that the pasta is sort of bland and the spicing in the packet is lacking.  It could have some more onion flavor, or more than 0.5% garlic or something.<br /><br />The value in this is what I believe to be parboiled pasta that can be cooked in this fashion.<br /><br />The net weight of this stuff is 12.8 ounces - with a pound of beef, it makes 5 one cup servings.  My wife guesses that it serves three adults, or six-eight toddlers (if you were making lunch for a day care, say).<br /><br />Now, this is my suggestion:<br /><br />Suppose you buy a piece of velveeta in the store, some cream, some beef, and a little garlic powder, some onion powder, and some pasta.<br /><br />Cook a quarter pound of pasta in one pan, boiling and draining normally, and then brown a pound or two of beef with a bunch of onion and garlic powder, to taste.  In a third pan (or in the one you boiled the pasta in), grate or cube about a pound of Velveeta and heat it gently with a 2 tbsp of butter, stirring frequently until melted, then add about 1/4 to 1/2 cup cream a little at a time while stirring. Add a little white pepper and 1/8 tsp nutmeg, if you like it. Or use sour cream instead of whole cream, or put a little beef broth into the beef after it has browned.<br /><br />Now combine the cheese sauce, the pasta (use more or less to taste, the beef (please don't drain it unless you are on a low fat diet, and then do so carefully - if you have one of those old fat brushes, use that, try to save the juices).  Then add a whole can of Ro-Tel, to your family's taste, hot, mild, lime-chili, whatever.  Taste it - and if it is bland, fix it.<br /><br />Dust the top with paprika before serving it.<br /><br />This dish will taste good, and it won't take you much longer to make it than it would to start with this mix.  And if it is bland, you have only yourself to blame.  You can put more or less salt, pepper, herbs, and whatever - you don't need to use a mix to make a cheese/macaroni/beef dish.  This stuff really isn't that hard.<br /><br />Now, there is nothing wrong with Velveeta.  It melts nicely, it makes a great cheese sauce.  It usually has some flavor.  And there is nothing wrong with this stuff except that it is just tasteless, and almost anyone can do better.  Seriously, YOU can do better than this bland product.  If you like Velveeta, use it. If you don't like Velveeta, well, making it yourself allows you to make your cheese sauce from a different type of cheese.  Mexican melting cheese is good.  Heck, Sargento six cheese is great.<br /><br />If you don't want to do it yourself, save money and buy Hamburger Helper.<br /><br />I can't rate this less than 3 stars, far as I can tell, it is wholesome and it doesn't actively taste bad. It doesn't actively taste of much at all.  So it gets three stars, and a suggestion that you can do so much better by doing it yourself that you should try.<br /><br />If I had some of this stuff I had to use, I'd:<br /><br />Add a half tsp of white pepper, a half tsp of paprika, garlic powder to taste and onion powder to taste.  I might consider a knorr garlic cube.  Or Chipotle.  I would always add the Ro-Tel, this is the biggest fix you can make to this stuff. Paprika to dust the top before serving.  And, well, beef broth instead of water - that "seasoning" is really, really bland. A dollop of sour cream when you put the cheese sauce in, and a tablespoon of butter.<br /><br />Because as shipped, it is horribly bland.
