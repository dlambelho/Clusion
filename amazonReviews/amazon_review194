If you're looking at this bulk item, chances are you already know you like the cereal, so I'll skip trying to explain what it tastes like, and tell you about what you'll get and how you'll get it.<br /><br />The package you get is a pretty big Amazon box with another cardboard box inside it--that inner box is manufacturer packaging/shipping material which holds the 6 bags of cereal. You can open that box as normal by cutting the packing tape, or the box has perforations so grocery stores (the obvious intended recipients) can rip off the side & top of the box, making what the box calls a "presentation display", I guess because the bags, lacking their own boxes, might not stand on end by themselves. So you get the package Nature's Path sends to grocery & health food stores, and I guess that's the way Amazon does it with most of their grocery stuff.<br /><br />This was my first Amazon grocery order. The flakes didn't seem to be damaged from their trip. The flakes on this product are pretty hard and small anyway, which I'm sure helps. Looking at the six bags of cereal (I cut the packing tape instead of doing the "display" rip-out), you kind of wonder to yourself and say, "That doesn't look like x amount of dollars worth of cereal". But cereal boxes are packaged so inefficiently, that part of it is an optical illusion. I was able to fill up my refillable cereal container and still have maybe 1/4 of the bag left. One of these bags (32oz) is a little more than two of the "box" versions (13oz).<br /><br />I'll probably close and maybe even re-tape the box while I deplete my mass quantities to keep any curious pests out.<br /><br />While I did get this econo-bag version over the smaller 6-boxes version in order to save money, buying online in itself was not in order to save money. As two reviewers so far have noted, Whole Foods (when they have them) will sell these bags individually or in bulk for a little less. However, that's probably the only reasonably-priced thing in the whole building, as one of my friends calls the place "Whole Paycheck", and which is why I don't shop there anymore (that... and also because I moved to a state where they don't have them!).<br /><br />So getting to a store which actually stocks this cereal is difficult to me. Amazon's free shipping mitigates the price to where it's at least a fair price: close or even with whatever else your best deal would be, especially if you factor in gasoline to make a special trip. You might end up saving money, but for me it's a time and fuel saver, without paying more. Yes, I had to purchase a lot, but it WILL get eaten, even if it takes me a looong time. The upside is that I'm not gonna run out anytime soon! I haven't had this cereal for a year, since I moved! I really missed it!<br /><br />Further product info: it took me awhile to figure out the difference between Nature's Path "Heritage" and "8 Grain" cereals. They look and taste similar, and have very similar ingredients. The biggest difference (in my book) is the use of Kamut for Heritage. Kamut is essentially a "proprietary" grain, supposedly an extinct form of durum wheat obtained from ancient tombs in Egypt. This is disputed by some, who believe it's a "landrance", or regional variation, kind of like how a border collie is still a collie, not a whole new breed. Regardless, the importance to many consumers is the lack of genetic modification. But Kamut planting is strictly licensed, and it's only allowed to be grown organically, so there are extra costs and controls involved--in other words, it's more expensive, or at least more involved, for cereal makers to make stuff using Kamut than just buying wheat off the open market. Interestingly, Nature's Path charges exactly the same amount for both cereals. So, all other things being equal, I choose "Heritage" over "8 Grain" because of the Kamut. Further comparison: 8 Grain has rice and corn, which I consider to be almost fillers, especially rice. Heritage has neither, but has Spelt AND Quinoa, both very nice grains in my view. 8 Grains is heavier on oats.<br /><br />AMAZON DOESN'T LIST MILLET IN THE INGREDIENTS, but it is in there (a good thing) (it is listed in 8 Grain). Millet is an underrated grain, too often associated only with cheap birdseed. 8 Grain also has Buckwheat; Heritage doesn't. Because of the near-equal tradeoffs, I used to buy both 8 Grain and Heritage locally, and mix them together. Bulk-buying on Amazon precludes this at the moment. Either way, you can't lose. I see Amazon sells a puffed Millet cereal; it's cheap and I might 'spike' my mix with that. I also hear Amaranth will pop like popcorn; I don't know if that would work for cereal, too.<br /><br />Heritage/8 Grain are not as sweet as traditional cereals, and it takes about 2 seconds to get used to that, and after that i find myself wishing it were even less sweet (cane juice is the second ingredient in Heritage, but the fourth ingredient in 8 Grain).
