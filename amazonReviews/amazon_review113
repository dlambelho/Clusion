A TRUE REPLACEMENT<br />After 60 years, I've broken my sugar addiction. Before pure Stevia, I used Splenda and later Truvia/Purevia (Stevia cut with bulking agents) for several years. The Truvia/Purevia were better than Splenda, but both the Splenda and Truvia/Purevia left disgusting residues and just didn't taste right (because of the fillers or bulking agents added).  More importantly for me, I could not fully enjoy my gourmet coffee with either. When I first began using pure Stevia, I appreciated the better flavor and lack of a residue, but it still did not taste quite like sugar to me. However, after 6 months of pure Stevia, it tastes like sugar to me, and I am again enjoying gourmet coffee.<br /><br />Perhaps more precisely, pure stevia is "as satisfying" as sugar for "cutting the edge" of bitter or sour drinks and foods---the way most people use sugar. However, it is not as intensely sugary-sweet, regardless of how much you use. For a rare, once-a-month "desert" cup of fine coffee, I still use real sugar and real cream.  Caveat: I find Splenda to be taste better in lemonade.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO KAL PURE STEVIA EXTRACT<br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER contains the natural fiber Inulin as a bulking agent. KAL STEVIA POWDER does not.  The Inulin does not seem to affect the flavor nor leave a yucky residue (as do the nasty bulking agents in Truvia/Purevia).  Possibly due to the Inulin, SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier thand KAL STEVIA POWDER. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder - 3.5 oz - Powder</a><br /><br />CAUTION<br />Inulin is a polysaccaride sometimes used as a sugar substitute itself (for diabetics).  It has about 1/4 to 1/3 the sweetness of sugar, and about 1/4 to 1/3 the caloric content---which I interpret to mean the same calories for the same sweetness (however, in this case much of the sweetness is contributed by the Stevia).  Inulin is a current food fad, with the usual (probably greatly exaggerated) claims of benefits, including improving digestion, reducing cholesterol, particularly triglycerides, protection from intestinal cancer, etc.  On the otherhand, it causes digestive problems in some people.  I suggest reading the Wikipedia article.  If (like me), you don't have digestive problems with inulin, and it sounds as though the various benefits may be significant for your particular health problems---I suggest arranging for blood tests after a month of using inulin, and a month after not using inulin to compare.  I used Sweetleaf Stevia for 6 months, and noticed no benefits, and my blood tests showed no improvement.  Perhaps coincidentally, I did nave a digestive-related problem, and my liver function was worse.  So, I returned to KAL Stevia.  Perhaps coincidentally, after three months, the digestive-related problem has not re-occured and my liver function has improved (as measured by blood tests).  I don't know if the inulin caused me any problems, but I do not believe it was any benefit.<br /><br />EASE OF USE<br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER and KAL LIQUID STEVIA are easier to measure than KAL STEVIA POWDER, because the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER comes with a tiny spoon which I find works perfectly well for measuring stevia for my coffee.  However, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is so concentrated that it is difficult to sprinkle over a sliced fruit dish.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000W0G62E">Pure Stevia Liquid Extract - 4 oz - Liquid</a><br /><br />SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER dissolves easier than KAL STEVIA POWDER.  That is not a problem for hot drinks, but SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER or KAL LIQUID are preferable for cold drinks, such as iced tea or limonade. I also find that unsweetened fruit cups etc. are just too sour for my taste---a few drops of the KAL LIQUID STEVIA makes them perfect.<br /><br />ECONOMY<br />$15.22 for 2 4oz bottles of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER versus $18.44 for 1 3.5 oz of KAL STEVIA POWDER (the price at the time of this writing, both with free shipping on orders >$25) may seem a bargain, but the KAL STEVIA POWDER is much more concentrated.  A 3.5oz jar of KAL STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 2381 servings.  A 4oz bottle of SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER claims to hold 230 servings (= 460 servings for 2 bottles).  The economy of KAL LIQUID is probably similar to SWEETLEAF STEVIA POWDER.<br /><br />I use "3 servings" per mug of strong coffee, so 1 bottle (3.5oz) of KAL STEVIA POWDER = 600 mugs of coffee, to my taste; while 2 bottles (8 oz) of SWEETLEAF STEVIA = 153 mugs of coffee.  So, the KAL STEVIA POWDER is clearly the winner for pure economy, but even the SWEETLEAF STEVIA is far cheaper and superior to Truvia/Purevia.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />For coffee and other hot drinks, KAL POWDER is the most economical.  For cold drinks, fruit etc. SWEETLEAF POWDER (or KAL LIQUID) is more convenient.<br /><br />General Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your reciept, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.
