I worked in the pet food industry for 13 years as a nutrition specialist my job was to research the market for trends break down nutrition and work in a team to create formulations based on digest ability and work on points of interest for sales teams.<br /><br />I also worked on the sales teams for 6 out of the 13 years In the field as inside sales so I'm well informed on the in and outs of how the industry works, looking at a ingredient label the first 4 ingredients make up 95% of the product while minerals etc are important what is the most important out of every thing else is the protein !<br /><br />Your dog and cat have not evolved over time to digest grain or vegetables so protein is the number one ingredient you are looking for in a food and there are several different types used while a lot of companies try and put a marketing spin on shapes colors and brightly target advertising on vegetables and fruits which are targeted more at the people not the dogs or the cats.<br /><br />Dogs and cats can not break down vegetable protein as well as meat they do no get enough out of it, and despite what common sense tells you do not want a whole protein in a dry food because through the baking process water is removed and you only end up with a faction of the mass it started out as.<br /><br />So in a first ingredient you want a protein meal not counting by products and it is not that by products are bad it's just that they include a lot of bones and cartilage that take away from the actual protein that you are looking for, a protein meal simply means concentrated source of protein with water removed<br /><br />If you have a protein meal in the first ingredient and then say ingredient 3 or 4 is a byproduct meal that is okay because the main source of protein is a more pure source no matter what dry food you get you need a grain as a binder to hold it all together and over the years there has been a huge amount of attention on corn while not all for nothing corn or any grain should never be a main ingredient of the source of the food It is cheaper than rice and not nearly as digestible there are different types used<br /><br />Corn gluten simply means the hard outer shell removed which means its mainly a vegetable protein source with very few minor minerals, which is usually used as a protein filler or binder or both the level on the ingredient list depicts what is it used for in the formulation if it is in the main ingredients the first 4 it's a protein filler to boost protein levels which is essentially adding false readings on the nutritional label usually found in foods high in byproduct meals<br /><br />Ground yellow corn is the most common and has not had the hard outer shell removed which is used as a filler and binder also reduces the digest in the animal<br /><br />Ash you want very low ash content in any food source it will raise the PH balance of the urine causing spots in your yard but most importantly causing urinary tract infections in dogs also but cats are very susceptible to this<br /><br />Any way on to my review of this food this is what I use for my cats it is a reasonably priced food that borders on the good and the bad but more to the good while not the best there is on the market, working in the industry for far to many years i can not bring myself to buy over priced foods when there are decent options out there like this one, like I said I worked in the industry and I know how it works in pet stores you walk in and the "best foods" are closer to the front door and this is not because they are the best those company's buy those spots on the shelf and at the end of the day every single employee has been bought also by the company they work for in that pet store, I used to train those employees in those stores "propaganda" it's not that the company with the big white bag is the best  those veterinarians had there schooling paid for by that company information is so convoluted<br /><br />It's not that corn is bad for your dog or cat it's how it was processed and how it is implemented in the formula. Your bag of food says farm raised chicken well so is foster farms, we only use white meat, what makes that better than dark meat ? Is it the price does it taste better to your dog ? No of course not ... Yogurt ? When it is the 19th ingredient on the list how much do you think is in the bag ?<br />And in the wild how much yogurt did your dog eat ?<br /><br />It's all marketing you can achieve the same effect as yogurt for a upset stomach with oatmeal and it is much cheaper the point in my rant here is to educate and make you think there is a science and once you know it every thing becomes more clear there is no reason to break the bank and don't believe the hype just because they work for a pet store does not mean they are a know all.<br /><br />Have a Great Day !
