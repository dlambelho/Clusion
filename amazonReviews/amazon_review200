No "real" Indian cook would do anything but use all individual spices to make a curry - ha!  "Real Indian cooks" use spice mixtures like garam masala all the time.<br /><br />This is more than just spices, like curry powder.  It has onions, lime, and so forth.  As soon as I opened the packet, my wife began craving naan, Indian bread - the fragrance was just wonderful, and reminiscent of what you smell in an Indian Restaurant.<br /><br />I used about two pounds of chicken with bones and skin on to one packet, browned the chicken very lightly, and added the packet of paste.  I should have poured off some chicken fat before adding the paste.  Then I added about 2.5 cups of water and simmered for about a half hour covered, and gave it more than 5 minutes on high - basically I was just judging the reduction - I stirred about once a minute during that part.<br /><br />In the meantime, the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0022SZGZM">Wolfgang Puck WPPCR005 5-Quart Electronic Pressure Cooker</a> was working on the rice.  The rice was done well before the 25 minute period was up.<br /><br />There are some great ideas in these reviews.  I have used a peeler on zuccini and yellow squash to make thin sheets of vegetable for sauteing, peeling all the way through the veggie - I would do that while the stuff was cooking for 25 minutes and add it just as you entered the "five minutes on high" period, add some to the sauce and turn it - I think it would taste great.  For the first batch I was just getting a baseline.  Yogurt was a good idea, maybe a little sour cream? Or heavy cream?<br /><br />Eggplant is another classic veggie that goes into curry. Of course, you can make homemade Indian cheese - you take a bunch of cow's milk, curdle it with lemon juice, yogurt or cultured buttermilk, and strain it in cheesecloth, three layers, pressing it under a plate that is weighted with a bowl of water after it drains to form it - look for recipes for paneer or panir on food.com.<br /><br />The point is that letting a butcher cube your chicken and mixing cubed chicken with water and this paste, simmering for 30 min, boil on high uncovered for 5 minutes, let sit for three - that is the basics and you can do so much more.  I argue that it is not harder to make a simple chicken curry using this paste than macaroni and cheese. I think the curry tastes better - your 3 year old may disagree :-).<br /><br />But the paste is essentially a spice and flavoring mixture.  If you love mixing and matching - if you always have onion soup mix in your pantry and have never made onion soup, well, this could be a winner.  I've taken a course in Indian Cooking at the CIA in Hyde Park, NY. I still have a mortar and pestle n my kitchen, because to do it "right" you need to grind your spices and it is marginally better to use a crushing mortar than a chopper grinder.  And you need about half a dozen reasonably fresh spices - cumin, cardamom (green and black) and black peppercorn, mustard seed and oil to make a spice cake, coriander, tumeric, nutmeg, cinnamon, dried ginger (I don't grind this myself), dried chili -  there is an article in wikipedia that lists many Indian spices.  You want to grind the spices the day you use them, in most cases.<br /><br />Most people (me, these days) are unwilling to do this, so they take shortcuts.<br /><br />This is a shortcut.  And the flavor is as good as I've ever had in a premix like this.  I've had worse in restaurants.<br /><br />My wife has a very, very low tolerance for picante food (spicy hot).  She found the curry spicy and tolerable - she felt that the food was spicy hot but it was not at all intolerable.<br /><br />I have a high tolerance for heat.  I found the "hot" spiciness almost unnoticeable, while the rest of the spicing was bold and simple but not excessive for Indian food, (where they use a lot more spice in one dish than, say, the City of Cleveland, Ohio does in a week). The flavors were simple, and no one flavor predominated.  The spicy flavor penetrated the entire piece of chicken during the cooking - this was true of both the thighs and the whole split breast that I used.<br /><br />If you want a spice mixture that makes a good simple curry and is easy to use, and you are willing to forgo the subtle but sublime feeling of accomplishment that you get when you perfectly create something so tasty that it gets you high while you are eating it, if you are willing to "settle" for good, tasty food, this curry paste is a good choice.<br /><br />Yes, there is Indian food like that, I cooked it when I was in that class and for some time after, but I'm older and my new wife likes Indian food some but not all that much, so this is perfect.  I don't consider that the point of this product - that you can hand spice something so that it is better than a commercial curry does not reflect badly on this product at all - this is five star curry paste.
