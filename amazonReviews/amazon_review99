I'll admit this up front: I'm not an energy drink consumer.  I've never had a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0021L9XK4">5 Hour Energy</a>, nor a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MTST70">Red Bull</a> (even mixed in with something else), nor a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006IMBHVU">Monster</a>, etc.  This was my first-ever energy drink.<br /><br />Don't shake.  This is a carbonated beverage.<br /><br />Given my energy drink virginity and the can's color scheme and artwork, I expected something the color and consistency of an unholy mix of blood and motor oil, smelling of saddle leather and diesel exhaust, and tasting like fire and going down like acid.  I mean, really, black and red, with a scarred, angry skull?  Who exactly is the target demographic, resentful Goths and sociopaths?  Bikers?  Posers who want to look badass?  The product description here says it's the "toughest can on the shelf by far."  What does that mean, that the can is specially structurally reinforced, so that it's, like, hard to open?  Or am I supposed to somehow believe that I'm the toughest by far because I am able to keep it down?  Or does their "tough" mean they've packed this stuff with so much mega-engineered super-energy power that they're toying with the very elements of time and existence?  I'm having a hard time reconciling the product inside with the can and text outside.<br /><br />So, I was very pleased to find it was not what I expected.  Poured from the can, the beverage is light and flows as any water-based liquid, with no gloppy, syrupy viscosity.  The color is a clear reddish, with a tinge of pink, no cola-brown.  The scent is quite nice, distinctly fruity, with more than a hint of berry.<br /><br />And the taste.  Thankfully, it didn't taste like something packed with sugar and caffeine.  It didn't taste like a product that would come out of a black can with a winged skull on it.  The drink's appearance and taste match nicely, with the taste being distinctly fruity/berry, with a pleasant and light dry fruity aftertaste.  I thankfully did not get any of that funky industrial-artificial chemical flavoring taste.<br /><br />I opened the can and tasted it at first at a cool room temperature, and it was passable, not at all nasty like some drinks can get when they warm in the slightest.  It is much, much better over ice.  The carbonation is light, nothing compared to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JXBHQK">Coke</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004JX9FDM">Pepsi</a>, and it fits the taste nicely.<br /><br />I ran it past a core consumer target, my 16-year-old daughter.  I did not tell her what it was, and she liked both the scent and taste.  She mentioned she tasted a little bit of peach.  She was surprised that it was an energy drink, and without prompting said it tasted unlike any energy drink she's ever had, better than both Red Bull and Monster.<br /><br />And the "nutrition" stats: 130 calories and 87mg of caffeine, 34g carbs, and with plenty of sodium and potassium, etc.  All this is interesting, until you see that this is for an 8-ounce serving; the can contains two servings, so double everything.  Also interesting is reading on the can: "Not recommended for children, pregnant women or people sensitive to caffeine," and, "This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease."  I'm not too sure what to make of these statements, but I know for a fact I've never read it on any of my beloved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004K9C4ZG">Diet Dr. Pepper</a>.<br /><br />There is 2000mg of taurine, also known by its handy nickname 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, in every can.  That's ten times the amount of anything else in the can, so I have to infer it's supposed to be a good thing.  The Interweb has a lot to say about taurine, essentially that it's naturally occurring and a needed thing for humans.  My quick survey has the usual daily intake at somewhere between 40 and 200, so this can is dropping a good ten times that on you.  I guess the logic is that a little is good so a lot is better, but that usually is not the case when it comes to the fine-tuning of body chemistry.  One source says, "the influence of high taurine doses on [crucial physiological] processes is uncertain."  Another source says, "...a 2003 study by the European Food Safety Authority found no adverse effects for up to 1,000mg of taurine per kilogram of body weight per day."  So, that means at 220 pounds you can slop up 100,000mg/day, 50 count `em 50 cans of this product.  So there you go, definitive ambiguity.<br /><br />As for super energy, I drank my pint of No Fear at about 4:30pm after a morning coaching high school rugby practice, then straight to marching in a St. Patrick's parade, then home to loading/unloading rugby gear, laundering jerseys, storing gear and supplies and parking a full trailer by hand.  After 30 minutes I did feel considerably more energetic, and had a slight headache.  Are the two related?  Maybe, but then again, maybe not.  No convulsions, no heart attack, no trembling hands, slurred speech, or eruptive bleeding from my eyes.<br /><br />Bottom line: After decades of drinking diet soda, this just isn't my kind of drink, and I'm unlikely to purchase it, if anything because of it caloric content.  That being said, I did like its taste, and don't have a problem recommending it to folks who like energy drinks.
