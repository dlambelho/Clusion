Not so impressed with this hummus. Then again, I've not been positively impressed with any canned or bottled hummus I've had. My search continues, but for "emergency hummus" to have on hand, choices are slim. I see a business opportunity for someone.<br /><br />Despite the claim of being made in Israel, this hummos reminds me of someone talking in a "Ja'fakin" accent. Taste and ingredients don't really add up.<br /><br />Check out the Ja-fakin' ingredients:<br />Chickpeas, tehina, water. Good so far. Vegetable Oil (Cottonseed and/or Soy) ["what what WHAT?"], Dextrose, salt, "Edible Starch" (huh?), Citric Acid, and "spices".<br /><br />Let's break this down:<br />- No olive oil. They use literally the cheapest edible oil obtainable.<br />- Dextrose. That's potato sugar. What's that in there for?<br />- "Edible" starch? I would hope so! Does the fact that it's edible need to be mentioned? Just what kind of starch? And why is it in there? Clearly a thickener, to stretch their ingredients (saves them $ while they charge you a lot). So they can add more water and fewer chickpeas. As if chickpeas are expensive.<br />- Citric Acid. This is to provide the tartness that LEMON JUICE would normally provide in a "real" recipe.<br />- "Spices". LOL, seriously. They're not keeping any big secrets here! Traditional hummus would call for cumin, and perhaps garlic. Why so vague?<br /><br />Okay, okay. Search for a positive point.<br />Okay: no preservatives. I wouldn't buy a non-perishable hummus with something like sodium benzoate in it. Most of the fresh mass-produced versions do (think the stuff you find in the refrigerated non-frozen section at Costco), and while the fresh variety taste much better, the preservatives really bother me with those.<br /><br />Some might also see as a positive that these cans come with a pull tab and a soft plastic cap to put over the can when you put it in the fridge. I find that wasteful. I now use a Kuhn-Rikon safety can opener, which enables me to put can tops back on, and I also get no sharp edges of the pull tab.<br /><br />To me, Yehuda hummus is noticeably thin. I haven't seen anyone mention this. It will easily run out of the jar if you upend it. By the way, I always open these jars on the bottom, because they're too full to stir (shaking beforehand doesn't help), and getting to eat the thicker hummus first which has settled to the bottom, almost reminds me of eating real hummus &lt;lol>.<br /><br />The taste? Not much taste. The first taste I get is an weird almost peanut buttery flavor (a common ingredient in REALLY fake hummus), though I'm sure it's not and probably has something to do with the kind of tahini they use (I actually have a can of Yehuda tahini too but haven't had the nerve to try it yet). After that, I feel a little tang of the ja-fakin' citric acid. After that, I notice the watery and overly-smooth texture of this hummus. I then notice I don't have much of a chickpea taste. I then feel glad I'm eating hummus at all. I then realize that these cans are too small, and I shouldn't be able to finish a whole one myself in one sitting, even if I do really like hummus and yes I was hungry.<br /><br />I've tried the Wild Garden variety too (in little glass bottles). It was a long time ago, and the ingredients are also ja-fakin, but I think the taste was better, and IIRC it was a little thicker. No preservatives either. Jars are a little bigger than Yehuda cans, and it's cheaper to boot, but not by much. I can't understand why hummus is so expensive, since chickpeas are dirt cheap.<br /><br />Amazon does actually sell a legit bottle hummus in its 'gourmet' section (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001J89GR0">"L'Epicurien Chickpea Cream Hummus"</a>), but it's fantasically expensive for what you get. However, its truly legit ingredients read almost like a recipe book: chickpeas 51%, tahini (sesame paste), extra virgin olive oil, sunflower oil, lemons, cider vinegar, garlic, concentrated lemon juice, spices (of which cumin is 0.22%). Looks like someone makes it in their kitchen. I told you there were opportunities with this stuff.<br /><br />I also found some canned "hummos" in the international section of a grocery store which came from an Arab country, like Lebanon or something. Now THAT stuff was not even passable, unlike Yehuda and Wild Garden, which are passable, just not great. I've even tried dry hummus "mix" in desperation, one of those big dry mix names like Fantastic (I don't remember), and that was a disaster, on the lines of my canned Arab hummos, actually worse if that's possible. I do like the Falafel from dry mixes, just not hummus.<br /><br />I've never had a fresh hummus which wasn't better than a non-perishable variety, and that includes the fresh mass-produced stuff at Costco, which is remarkably consistent in flavor and texture, despite them sourcing from different brands. I've also tasted fresh hummus made by a friend, and had hummus in two different restaurants, one a vegan retaurant and another a fancy mediterranean place. So I may not be an expert, but I've been around.<br /><br />My opinion is anyone who thinks this is great hummus, has never had great hummus. Or even "good" hummus. You can't have "great" hummus made with fake, corner-cutting ingredients.<br /><br />For now I plan to go back to Wild Garden for my "emergency hummus" quick fix (yes I keep whole wheat pitas frozen for such occasions!). But I'm still searching! I see Amazon sells a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HP5HX8">Manischewitz brand hummus</a>, but as of this writing it's unavailable. Any other alternatives? Leave me a comment.<br /><br />Oh, if you're in doubt, my hummus philosophy is: don't go with those trukey fancied-up kinds ("roasted red pepper", etc). It's hard to improve on a recipe which is thousands of years old. YMMV. If you're not sure, get the "traditional" kind (Yehuda is at least legit in the sense that they only sell one kind of hummus: "Hummus"! Not "Traditional Flavor", not "Original Flavor", just Hummus!). You also may want to drizzle some olive oil on your serving, too.
