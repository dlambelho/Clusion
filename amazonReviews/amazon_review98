I'm writing this review as I sip the Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea.<br />It has a subtle honey flavor throughout and I also taste the lemongrass flavor especially in the beginning (you would smell the nice lemon scent as well). I taste green tea flavor also but its flavor becomes more definite during the aftertaste. If you like herbal teas, I think you would like this tea as well.<br /><br />Like other Yogi tea, I like that the tea never gets bitter even if I brew it longer than I suppose to (3 minutes). One tea bags make at least two cups of tea.<br /><br />As far as muscle recovery effects goes, I "think" I'm feeling a difference. I have been working out 5 times a week, and when I drink Yogi Green Tea Muscle Recovery tea, I do not have prolonging muscle aches longer than a day. However, I have to point out that it might be because I am getting used to my work out routine and need to push myself a little further to start feeling the "pain" again :-P Anyhow, this is okay as I'm not expecting a complete muscle recovery from a one herbal tea bag. What I like most about this tea so far is that its gentle scent and flavor definitely helps me to relax after each workout. I like to think and visualize that my muscle are growing as I sip this tea and it's a plus psychologically :-)<br /><br />I initially found this tea at local Whole Foods market.<br />Purchasing this tea (pack of 6) from Amazon is cheaper than buying it individually from Whole Foods, and probably many other natural food stores. I hope Amazon will start having the Subscribe & Save option for this product like other Yogi teas.<br /><br />[UPDATE: Oct 12, 2011]<br />Amazon now offers Subscribe & Save option! :-)<br /><br />I extracted description/effects of the top 3 ingredients (Green Tea Leaf, Lemongrass, and Blackberry Leaf) that contains the most in each tea bag as well as some other ingredients that Yogi Tea claims to play an important role in this product.<br /><br />Green Tea Leaf:<br />- contains the most antioxidant polyphenols, which are responsible for its many health benefits.<br />- is a more potent antioxidant than broccoli, carrots, spinach or strawberries.<br />- enhances immunity and benefit oral health.<br />- balance total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, as well as triglycerides, and to support a healthy ratio of LDL cholesterol to HDL cholesterol.<br /><br />Lemongrass:<br />- supports mucous membrane function, and it is used to promote sweating.<br />- is a warming herb that speeds digestion and reduces gas and nausea.<br /><br />Blackberry Leaf:<br />- its vitamin C and tannins in the leaves helps boost immunity and heal wounds.<br />- contains ellagic acid, which is a powerful cell protector and antioxidant.<br />- is a source of mild astringent compounds (tannins), which tighten up and dry out loose, soggy tissue (so blackberry leaf has been used traditionally to ease minor sore throat, diarrhea and skin rashes).<br /><br />Devil's Claw Root Extract:<br />- Native to southern Africa<br />- is a shrub that has lush foliage and red flowers (The plant gets its name from its fruits, which look like a hooked, gnarled claw).<br />- Historically, African people have employed the root for a wide range of conditions; from digestive function to joint support.<br />- Since its introduction to Europe in the early 1900s, the use of devil's claw root has spread throughout the world, and continues to be used primarily for joint support.<br /><br />Yucca Root-Herbs:<br />- A desert plant that grows in the Southwestern part of the United States and in Mexico.<br />- is a Native American remedy used to soothe irritation of all sorts, and to support healthy joints and skin.<br />- The main nutritional agents are saponins, which have a soapy consistency. Native Americans used yucca as soap due to its lathering effect and also as a blood cleanser.<br /><br />Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract:<br />- is not a true ginseng, but a cousin of Asian ginseng.<br />- has gained that nickname due to the fact that Siberian natives use it as a broad spectrum health enhancer, much the way ginseng is used.<br />- has a long-term stamina enhancing effect.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS (as it appears on the product package):<br />Organic Green Tea Leaf, Organic Lemongrass, Organic Blackberry Leaf, Natural Lotus Flower Flavor, Rose Petal, Organic Skullcap Leaf, Organic Lemon Myrtle, Organic Turmeric Root, Yucca Root Extract, Ginseng-Eleuthero Extract (Panax ginseng, Panax quinquefolium, Eleutherococcus senticosu), Stevia Leaf, Cat's Claw Bark Extract (Uncaria tomentosa, Phenols 15%, Alkaloids 3%), Devil's Claw Root Extract.<br /><br />PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:<br />Stay active with a cup of Green Tea Muscle Recovery(tm). Our satisfying blend starts with gently stimulating and antioxidant-rich organic green tea and combines it with traditional soothing herbs such as organic turmeric root, one of the most widely used herbs in India. We then add devil's claw root and yucca root--herbs from indigenous herbal traditions--to help decrease recovery time from the minor aches and pains that may result from exercise. What's more, ginseng-eleuthero extract helps you reenergize.* So get invigorated, be energized, and stay active with Green Tea Muscle Recovery!<br /><br />[Above information extracted from Yogi Website: [...]]<br /><br />[Edit: It seems I can not post Yogi web address on Amazon review.
