THREE MUSKETEERS has A L W A Y S been my favourite candy-bar.  No nugat or caramel to stick to your teeth, no peanuts to have to chew through, (or be endangered by, in case you are alleric to peanuts.)  No sticky, gooey mess, anywhere!  Just plain, fluffy, yumminess -- unless the bar is a bit too old, in which case the fluffiness turns to hard-to-chew crunchiness, or it gets too warm outside, in which case, the chocolate outer-shell begins, sadly, to melt.  But a fresh, new bar of traditonal Three Musketeers?  A preview of what Heaven must really be like, for sure!<br /><br />So, I am naturally interested in any new version of this product.  Shopping at a well-known chain store today, I happened to run across this product -- 3 MUSKETEERS TRUFLE CRISP BARS -- for the first time.<br />Hmmmm....I had never even heard of them before -- but at 3 for $2, I naturally had to try them.<br /><br />"Truffles", in whatever form, do, of course, betwoken "gourmet".  Truffle-type mushrooms are expensive gourmet treats, often added to "pate de foie gras" (goose-liver paste), a French delicacy -- or sold in tins by themselves for (deservedly?) exhorbitant amounts of money.  Believe it or not, mushroom truffles can ONLY be found in the wilds...by specially-trained pigs!  This is part of the reason why they're so expensive, I guess.<br /><br />Chocolate truffles are made of chocolate, praline, and ground hazelnuts.  They are also a gourmet treat, (for desert, this time) but are not quite as expensive as mushroom truffles. Although I have never had the pleasure of eating muschoom truffles, I HAVE enjoyed chocolate truffles on occasion -- and can attest that they are totally scrumptions!<br /><br />So, if chocolate trufles belong in ANY widely-sold candy bar, I was sure that 3 MUSKETEERS would be about the only one to do them justice.<br />Sadly, however, this is NOT the case.<br /><br />The new, 3 MUSKETEERS Truffle Crisp bar is ar more "crisp" than it is "truffle".  The picture on the outside wrapper shows the "crisp"<br />layer on the bottom, and the "truffle" layer on the top to be about 50% of the bar's filling, each.  However, opening up the bar and biting into it, one can see that the edges of the top, "truffle" layer have been ever-so-slightly indented, and taken off, and what should be "truffle" filling in this top-most, indented area, is instead a continuation of the chocolate which coats the entire bar.  Not that this chocolate coating isn't delicious -- but when one sees, on the wrapper, an illustration of an approximately 50-50 distribution of top and bottom fillings inside, that is what should be seen when exploring the candy-bar itself.  As it is, the distribution of filling in the REAL bar is about 45% truffle on top, and 55% crisp bar on the bottom.<br /><br />This new confection from "3 MUSKETEERS" comes with 2 bars per package.<br />This may be good for those watching their weight, because only one complete bar can be had, (if one has the will-power), per snack.  Or, it's easy to share the one package with two bars in it, with a friend.<br />However, it should be noted that the new, "Truffle Crisp" bar lists<br />only 1.10 ounces, (or 31.2 grams) as its net weight, (for both bars within), whilst the "old, reliable", traditonal "3 Musketeers" bar lists 2.13 ounces, (or 60.4 grams), as its net weight.  At the store I bought them out, both candies cost the same amount of money....<br /><br />On the back of the 3 MUSKETEERS TRUFFLE CRISP wrapper is listed the ingredients, (Milk Chocolate, (sugar, cocoa butter, chocolate, skim milk, lactose, milk fat, soy lechithin, PGPR, ((which is probably an abbreviation for an unpronoucable chemical product)), artificial flavour, vegetable oil, (palm kernel oil, palm oil, and/or hydrogenated palm oil), Less than 2% - corn syrup, egg whites, cocoa powder, salt. ALLERGY INFORMATION: May contain peanuts, tree nuts, and wheat,<br /><br />Under this, the "Daily Values", which, along with ingredient listing, is now mandatory to be put on all products, is highlighted.  In big lettering, under the rubric: "What's Inside", are the daily values of:<br />Calories: 170, (9%DV), Total Fat: 9 Grams, (14% DV), Saturated Fat:6 grams, (30% DV), Sugars: 18 grams, (No DV defined), Sodium: 30 mgs, (1% DV).  As usual, these values are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet.  Listed also is the helpful(?)

The "crisp" part of the bar overwhelms, and only a very, very slight flavour of the truffle part seems to reach the taste-buds.  The nearest thing it tastes like, in my mouth, is TWIX.  TWIX is a nice candy bar...but nowhere near as good as original 3 MUSKETEERS.  At least to my own taste.<br /><br />My recommendation?  Unless you totally adore crispy wafers wrapped in chocolate, go for the traditional "3 MUSKETEERS" bar, instead of the "3 MUSKETEERS TRUFFLE CRISP" bar.  The "Truffle Crisp" bar has a nice, undulating chocolate design on the top of each crisp bar -- but very little real chocolate taste -- and even less, real chocolate truffle taste -- inside.  For truffle taste, go for LINDT'S chocolate truffles.  For whipped, fluffy filling, go to the original 3 MUSKETEERS bar. For crispy bars, go to "TWIX" candy.<br /><br />I am looking forward to 3 MUSKETEERS next new product, however.  Perhaps this will be a whipped, dark chocolate version of the original bar(?)  At any rate, I have a feeling that this new, "Truffle Crisp" bar won't be on the market too long.  I could be wrong here...but if I'm not, then the "Truffle Crisp" bar may become a highly-prised collectible -- like the 80s cereal, "Quisp", which went out of major production many years ago.  However, the makers of "Quisp" DO make a very limited number of cereal boxes each year, for affictionados of "Quisp" cereal.  Maybe the same will, eventually, be done with the "Truffle Crisp" bar.  If MARS does, now, want to see sales rise on this new item, however, I suggest they keep the "crisp" part to the minimum, and add more and more of the "truffle" filling.  If this is done, it may be a nice adjunct to the original 3 Musketeers Bar -- which, in my opinion, is presently,<br />"Winner...And Still Champion!"  : )
