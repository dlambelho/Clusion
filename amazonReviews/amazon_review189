PROS:<br />One of the best and most pleasant tasting sugar substitutes<br />No bitter aftertaste<br />Similar consistency to sugar<br /><br />CONS:<br />Expensive compared to sugar and other sugar substitutes<br />Ounce for ounce, not as sweet as sugar<br />Might not be a perfect substitute for sugar in all baking applications<br />Cools down your hot beverages when it goes into solution/Cool aftertaste<br /><br />Swerve sweetener is a good, zero calorie substitute for sugar.  It is a reasonable alternative to sugar for use in coffee, tea, and even for some baking purposes.<br /><br />Swerve's main ingredient is erythritol but also has a proprietary blend of 'oligosaccharides and natural flavors.'  Erythritol is a sugar alcohol (or polyol) very similar to xylitol, another polyol that is often used to sweeten sugarless gum and other candies.  The company makes a big deal out of the fact that erythritol can occur naturally in some fruits and fermented foods, mass production of erythritol apparently involves the fermentation of natural sugars found in corn.<br /><br />Interestingly, I found that although erythritol is touted as a 'zero calorie' sweetener, it actually has 0.2 calories per gram.  This isn't quite zero, but is far less than the 3.8 calories per gram found in regular table sugar.<br /><br />Like the sugar alcohols xylitol and inulin, erythritol has a sweet flavor that closely resembles table sugar (sucrose), without the bitter aftertaste found in other sugar substitutes such as saccharin, sucralose (Splenda), and aspartame (NutraSweet). Unlike xylitol and inulin, however, erythritol is more digestible/absorbable, and hence does not cause as much GI upset/bloating.  Sadly, erythritol is only 70% as sweet as table sugar, so you need about twice as much product to get the same level of sweetness.  This is why erythritol is often used as a vehicle to bulk up other sweeteners, such as Stevia.<br /><br />As to baking, erythritol is not a perfect substitute for sucrose.  It has different hygroscopic (moisture absorbing) properties than sugar and apparently tends to crystallize more than regular sugar, depending on the application.<br /><br />True to its roots, Swerve has a pleasant, sweet flavor that is very reminiscent of sugar.  In spite of the hype on their website that Swerve--unlike other erythritol formulations from other companies--can replace sugar on a 1:1 basis, I found that Swerve was generally less sweet than sugar.  This did, however, depend on the application.<br /><br />In a side-by-side test, at room temperature, Swerve compared fairly to table sugar.  It was a little less sweet, but not by much.  Oddly, it seemed to initially tickle the sweet receptors on my tongue on first taste, but the sweetness quickly died down. Sugar's sweet taste seemed to linger longer.  Still, Swerve was devoid of any bitter aftertaste found in common artificial sweeteners and in Stevia.  However, I found that when I put Swerve in hot coffee, it took almost two teaspoons of the stuff to equal the sweetness of one teaspoon sugar.  Interestingly, when used to make brownies, I used 30% more Swerve than I would use sugar for the recipe and when they were done the brownies were sweeter than usual.  I wonder if temperature affects the sweet taste of the erythritol.  I can't seem to find any evidence for this, but it seems true for my taste buds.<br /><br />Some people have commented on experiencing a 'cool' after sensation on the mouth and tongue after tasting erythritol.  This is best described as the kind of cool sensation you get after tasting mint, but without the minty taste.  I did experience this a little with Swerve, but it wasn't bothersome or overwhelming. Interestingly, erythritol does absorb heat when it goes into solution, so it will make your coffee a tiny bit cooler after mixing it in.<br /><br />NOTE 1/31/2012:  I used powdered erythritol to make a butter cream frosting.  The consistency wasn't as thick and robust as it is with sugar, but it was fine.  However, the cooling effect was wild here.  Not necessarily unpleasant, but a little strange. Interestingly, by adding cocoa powder to the mix, the cooling effect was blunted a bit.  I will have to experiment with combinations of this sweetener with other ingredients to see if the cooling effect can be tamed or blunted.<br /><br />Another downside of erythritol is its price.  At current market rates 16 ounces (2 cups) costs twice as much as 16 ounces of boxed Domino sugar on Amazon.  In reality, if you buy a 5 pound bag of sugar at your local supermarket you can probably cut that down to about a dollar a pound, which makes Swerve about 14 times the price of table sugar at current rates.  Pretty expensive.<br /><br />On the whole this is one of the better sugar substitutes out there.  It is a nice compromise between the strange aftertastes of artificial sweeteners and the GI side effects of other sugar alcohols.  Although not quite as sweet as sucrose, it is a fine alternative.
