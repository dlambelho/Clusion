Wow!!! I am so happy I found this peanut butter. I grew up on Skippy and Jif (mostly Skippy) and have been trying different "natural" and organic peanut butters for a few years now because of the hydrogenated oils, etc., in all of the standard commercial products. But nothing has ever come close to the flavor and texture that I like & remember...until PB & Co.! I love that this has just a touch of sweetness as well as salt--I know we supposedly need to limit sodium consumption (though I expect the "latest wisdom" on that to change at some point, just like it seems almost all other nutritional advice has over the years), but most foods need at least a bit of salt to enhance flavor, and I've really missed that in other brands. They just taste too darn bland. Anyway...this pb is absolutely PERFECT! It hits all the right notes of peanutty, sweet, and salty goodness, it's packed with chunks of crunchy nuts, and it's spreadable on fruit, celery, crackers, etc., without the sloppy goopiness and oily separation of most of the naturals/organics out there--another HUGE plus in my book. I would give this many, many more stars if I could! I have found the peanut butter I will buy for the rest of my life!<br /><br />BTW, PB & Co.'s Dark Chocolate Dreams is also to die for--I mostly eat that a spoonful of that as a simple dessert or use it in sauces/baking, etc. IF you haven't had it yet, try it--you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />Also, after reading the comments in some other reviews about palm oil, I felt I had to include the following (which comes from [...], as well as the comments further below from PB & Co.'s web site, to set the record straight, as there is a lot of misunderstanding out there about palm *fruit* oil (vs. palm *kernel* oil, which is what is used in most commercial products). Similar info is available from several other reliable sources on the web.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />  The only oil that contains significant levels of all four types of tocotrienols is palm fruit oil.<br /><br />  Although tocopherols are generally sufficient for meeting minimum vitamin E levels and maintaining an average level of good health, there is far<br />  more to be gained from getting the full range of both tocopherols and tocotrienols. Rice bran oil, wheat germ, barley, oats, coconut oil and palm<br />  kernel oil all contain one or more types of tocotrienols as well; however, none besides palm fruit oil contain all four types. Palm fruit oil is<br />  composed of 30 percent tocopherols and 70 percent tocotrienols.<br /><br />  Tocotrienols are roughly 50 times more potent than tocopherols when it comes to antioxidant power. Recent studies have shown that tocotrienols<br />  distribute themselves more evenly than tocopherols do in the fatty layers of cell membranes. They are effective at preventing and treating serious<br />  degenerative diseases like cancer, stroke-induced injuries, diabetes, osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease. In one study, tocotrienols increased<br />  the lifespan of laboratory rats by 20 percent. Aside from preventing and treating these serious illnesses, palm oil improves blood circulation and<br />  prevents clotting, boosts immunity, improves general nutrient absorption, supports healthy lung and liver function, strengthens bones and teeth,<br />  reinforces eye health and supports brain function. Studies have shown that virgin red palm oil is the variety that offers the most medicinal<br />  benefit, but all varieties seem to be beneficial.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />From PB & Co.'s web site:<br /><br />  - I see that "palm fruit oil" is listed as one of the ingredients in your flavored peanut butters. What is it and why do you use it?<br />  Palm fruit oil is a non-hydrogenated, healthy alternative for creating natural peanut butter with less oil separation. It has been used in<br />  culinary applications since the beginning of recorded history. It is grown in tropical regions and is widely used as a culinary oil in many<br />  countries.<br /><br />  - I always thought palm oil was bad for you -- is your peanut butter still healthy?<br />  Our palm fruit oil contains no trans fats. Trans fats have come under scrutiny by the FDA as a link to major diseases including heart disease<br />  and cancer.<br />  Palm Fruit Oil is often confused with Palm Kernel Oil. Palm kernel oil is derived from palm kernels and contains 82% saturated fat.<br />  Palm Fruit Oil comes from the fruit of the palm and has a nutritionally balanced profile of approximately 50% saturated and 50% unsaturated fat.<br />  When safely processed using traditional methods, palm oil promotes health by providing important lipid antioxidants and fatty acids. A high<br />  percentage of the saturated fats in palm oil are supple long-chain fats, excellent sources of energy. In contrast, hydrogenated fats result from<br />  converting supple long-chain fats into still "plastic-like" short-chain fats, producing desirable texture in foods but highly undesirable results<br />  from a health standpoint.<br /><br />  - I've been hearing a lot about the destruction of rain forests in Indonesia to create palm plantations, and that the indigenous orangutan population<br />  is in danger. Where does your palm fruit oil come from?<br />  The palm fruit oil that is used in Peanut Butter & Co. products comes from Malaysia. Sustainability is a primary concern to our supplier,<br />  who is in fact one of the founding members of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO). The RSPO is comprised of governments, palm growers,<br />  palm oil users, and non-governmental organizations such as the World Wildlife Fund. Its goal is the preservation of the natural environment in a<br />  sustainable way that also permits reasonable growth of palm oil plantations that support local populations. For more information about the RSPO<br />  please visit their website [...].<br />  Peanut Butter & Co. is also a member of Green Palm, which offers a certificate trading program designed to tackle environmental and social<br />  problems created by the production of palm oil. Under this program, we are able to reward palm oil producers by paying them for an equivalent<br />  amount of palm oil that they have produced sustainably and responsibly.
