My wife and 15 year-old daughter don't drink coffee and are envious of my access to fresh coffee in my Keurig, one-cup-at a-time machine..  They do, however, love hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  The three of us were trying to decide which of many available boxes of Keurig compatible hot chocolate to order.  None seemed to have universally positive reviews, and most cost about a dollar per K-cup, which seems expensive for one home made mug.  We didn't want to make a mistake and buy 16, 32, or more, of a brand or type they didn't like.<br /><br />Voila!  Someone thoughtfully put nine varieties of hot chocolate in one box,  The "Keurig K-Cups Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack + Limited Edition Print." Plus, it included thirty-five cups of hot chocolate, and for under a dollar a cup.<br /><br />The Chocolate Lovers Sampler Pack arrived yesterday.  Tonight, the three of us enthusiastically ripped into the box containing nine different versions of hot chocolate/hot cocoa.  We even moved the Keurig machine from the kitchen to the family room for easier access as we watched TV and simultaneously  engaged in a chocolate lovers orgy, an orgy which I agreed to join.  Following a directive from my daughter, I made a special run to buy marshmellows.<br /><br />If we each had three cups of different hot chocolate, and traded sips, we would each have tasted all nine permutations of the Chocolate Lover's Sampler Pack, and know which of the nine were our favorites.<br /><br />My first cup was, ah... dissappointing.  It tasted a little like coffee, not hot chocolate, but was so weak I couldn't be sure.  My wife and daughter, were soon, "yucking" with disgust.  They both hate coffee, and I joined them in my evaluation of this coffee.  We tried container after container, and the result was repeated, over and over.  The K-cups fell into one of two categories:  weak bad coffee; or weaker bad coffee.  I couldn't discern more nuance than that.  I tried making a cup setting the water quantity for a tea cup.  Nope.  Still too weak.  (And I have many Keurig coffee's that I love.  They often have the word "bold" in the title, and I apparently do like strong coffee.  I'm not saying everyone will dislike these particular K-cups, only that I sure did, and doubly so since we had ordered a Sampler Pack of hot chocolate and hot cocoa.<br /><br />Finally, my daughter found one Green Mountain Hot Chocolate, and it was pretty good, but watery.  She found another and after reducing the water quantity down to the tea cup size, with a couple of marshmellows tossed in, that one cup was good.  One cup of hot chocolate out of 35 cups.  Some chocolate lover's orgy. :-(<br /><br />I considered the possibility that perhaps I'm partially to blame.  Maybe the item description said that this was really weak, bad coffee, and not hot chocolate at all.<br /><br />But the Chocolate Lover's Sampler is the 11th hit in a search of the, "Grocery and Gourmet Food," category using, "Keurig hot chocolate," as the search phrase.  There are 24 items on this first page alone, and three additional pages of hits follow.  Hit number 21, for example, is, "Cafe Escapes Hot Cocoa Milk Chocolate, 12-Count K-Cups."  The Chocolate Lover's Sampler is surrounded by Hot Chocolate.<br /><br />I've been buying items from Amazon since they were just a little stream, with some interesting rapids, not unlike the nearby Chatooga River which marks the Georgia/South Carolina border, and where the movie, "Deliverance," was filmed.  In all that time I have never given an item one star.  I usually only write reviews if I have had a five star experience.  So I gave it two, although one (1) would have been fully justified.<br /><br />Now, how do I get my money back, or a credit on some real hot chocolate?<br /><br />UPDATE:  THREE DAYS LATER.  Yesterday I explained our experience on the official feedback form, and referenced this review for more detail.  I asked for a refund of 5/6s of the purchase price.  This morning, less than 24 hours after describing my experience, this amount had been credited to my credit card.  While it's debatable whether this product deserves a rating as low as two stars based on the fact it doesn't contain the product I thought I was getting - it could be perfect for someone who wants a variety of flavored coffees - IMO, one thing is not debatable:<br /><br />Amazon's customer service is five stars, plus, and I offer that evaluation based on over a hundred purchases, ranging from a $5 HDMI cable, to a $34,027 Volvo XC Station Wagon*, stickered at $40,650.  And, I was able to avoid almost $2,400 in sales tax.  But get this, the young man who delivered this beauty insisted on washing it in my driveway, and refused to accept even a modest tip.  I hope this doesn't get him fired, but he did accept a freshly brewed, delicious cup of Keurig coffee (I had one, too) made with the Parisian Extra-Bold Dark Magic K-cup.)*<br /><br />* Just kidding.  I've purchased some expensive items but no car.  Yet.  But I'm not kidding about Amazon service:  Five Stars.
