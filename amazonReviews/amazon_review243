First of all, If you read nothing else, I have to say........BUY IT!<br /><br />Okay, that being said, here's more:<br /><br />For years I kept seeing flavored creams everywhere.  Why don't they make flavored sugars, I wondered.  Interesting that Splenda came out with flavored sugars, as it was about one year ago that I emailed the company with the idea.  Perhaps it is just a coincidence.  Anyway, it doesn't matter...it is really (really) good.<br /><br />I've tried them all.  Vanilla being my favorite.  Mocha a very, very close second, and hazelnut is a distant (but worth trying) third.<br /><br />All of the flavors are very (well...) flavorful.  So much so, that in a "travel mug" size coffee cup, I use one flavored packet of Splenda and one regular Splenda and it's plenty flavorful.<br /><br />The vanilla is very vanilla-y (which I happen to prefer to chocolate).<br /><br />The mocha is very chocolately and delicious, especially for me, not being a chocolate fan.<br /><br />The hazelnut I could take or leave and I would take it if the others weren't around.  It is not at all or in the least bit objectionable, however.<br /><br />My only objection to this Splenda is the packets themselves (those tall, skinny packets) are somewhat cumbersome to open the way they were intended to be opened, I think.<br /><br />You are supposed to fold over the top just slightly and then use the already slit part at the top to tear it apart.<br /><br />The problem lies in that when you tear it this way, it tears all the way down the packet and can spill out.  ...and if you stop tearing it at mid-package, you end up with a small "pocket" of torn package that you have to hold with one hand while dumping the contents out with the other.  Otherwise, the small torn part of the package gets filled with the sugar and you have to dump that out, too.<br /><br />So, I use my teeth to tear it across the top (the way you open a freeze pop) and that way avoid the whole "ordeal".<br /><br />It's REALLY not that big a deal, I'm just sayin', that's what happens.  (this is a review, afterall).<br /><br />Other considerations:<br /><br />I read that you can find the product at certain Walmart stores (just not one near me), which means that Sam's will have it soon (in bulk).<br /><br />It is a little expensive, about one dollar more per box than regular, but so is Starbucks, and frankly, it's worth it, and I hate Starbucks bitter (tastes like it's several hours old) coffee, anyway.<br /><br />I've also tried the vanilla Splenda in my Grape Nuts cereal, and didn't care for it as much as I thought I would.  I prefer plain Splenda for that, but you might really like it, and it wasn't too bad.<br /><br />I haven't tried it in hot chocolate, but I will and it will undoubtedly be good.<br /><br />The flavor is so concentrated that you could probably serve it in a cup of hot water, which I also haven't tried and am actually kidding about.<br /><br />You can tell how strong it is when you are opening it up with your teeth and you taste it.  You can also smell it in your coffee from across your desk. It's wonderful.<br /><br />I purchased one of each of these flavors on Amazon. (no doubt, it's a lot of Splenda, but there are no shipping fees, so it's a great deal).<br /><br />I am now the star of the office since it is not really out yet in the stores (around here) and everyone here loves it.<br /><br />The other thing I'd like to mention about Splenda (in general) is that it is the only "sugar substitute" made from real sugar.  The best thing about this is that it doesn't react in your body like real sugar does, but it tastes the closest to real sugar, in my opinion, than anything else.<br /><br />Most importantly, it does not cause an insulin response in your body, which is what happens when you eat real or (chemical) artificial sugar substitutes.<br /><br />This is a HUGE plus for your body since sugar is the BIGGEST EVIL in our weight gain problems in this country.  Sugar is many, many, many times more the culprit in weight gain than any fat could be, as far as making you fat goes, because sugar CONVERTS TO / BECOMES FAT upon our digestion of it.  So to have Splenda come out with a flavored sugar is just the greatest thing.  It's even better than sliced bread because I like my slices really thick and sliced bread usually isn't.<br /><br />Well, that's all folks...hope you enjoyed.<br /><br />Now, sit back and watch, all of the other sugar makers will be coming out with flavored sugars, soon, and then it will be everywhere.  Choose Splenda for your health!  Oh, and by the way, I do not work for Splenda, if that's what you were thinking, I just love it that much.<br /><br />Cheers!<br /><br />Anastasia
