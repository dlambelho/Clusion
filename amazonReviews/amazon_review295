Probably the best way for me to review this basket is to list each item included and state my reaction to it.<br /><br />Pomodoro-Basilico sauce, 25 ounce jar -- This is a very chunky tomato based sauce with a flavor totally different from jar sauces available in the grocery stores in my area.  I couldn't figure out what gave it that peppery taste until I saw that the ingredient list includes cayenne pepper.  There is enough there that we could definitely notice it.  There is also so much olive oil that it can be seen around the edges of the sauce.  Too much?  I don't think so, but I could see it quite clearly.  I think everything in the ingredient list was called "organic" with the exception of the spices.  The basil leaves were often still whole which wasn't exactly a pleasant thing to see and they felt slippery in my mouth.  A good sauce and probably fabulous when freshly made.  The jar was large enough to make a total of 4 servings with ample sauce on the pasta.<br /><br />Bumbola pasta, 12 ounce box - Made with organic semolina in antique bronze molds Coppola calls this shape "playful".  He is absolutely correct that it is rarely seen today and also correct that the shape allows it to hold lots of sauce easily.  This is the pasta I used with the jar of sauce provided in the basket.  Cooking half the box yields a generous amount for two servings.  I'm sorry to say I couldn't discern any special *taste* of the pasta but it is unusual visually.<br /><br />Gemelli pasta, 12 ounce box - Made with durum semolina on the antique molds this is a long, thin, spiral pasta which Coppola says has rough edges because of being made in the older molds so it holds sauces well.  I haven't tried this one yet.<br /><br />Almond and Anise Biscotti -- There are three pieces of biscotti and the anise flavor is quite pronounced.  I don't like anise so this was not a hit with me.  It was a little disconcerting that the sticker on the packet stated a sell by date of 03/01/13.  That is eleven months from now.  I was not pleased with that.<br /><br />Stainless Colander, 5 quart -- This is a large colander but please notice that it never claims to be stainless steel.  And it definitely isn't.  I picked it up expecting it to be stainless steel and almost threw it across the counter because it was so much lighter than I had expected.  My sticker on the bottom says Made in India and that sticker is super hard to remove.  The draining holes in the colander are very small and I have several colanders which are much superior in both quality and usability.  This was definitely not a hit.<br /><br />Kitchen towel/apron -- This is 31" x 26 1/2" with two selvage edges and two hemmed edges.  There is a color rectangle with the Mammerella picture logo on one lower edge.  This is so thin you can actually see through it.  It could be used in any way you chose because cooks normally have their own habits they follow when preparing a meal.  The texture is rather rough so I will definitely wash it several more times before I use it.  Probably not going to be used very much by me unless it softens up enough for a drying cloth.<br /><br />Recipe Card -- For Quick Mozzarella Pasta Sauce -- Let me just save you some trouble here.  Cook some pasta according to package directions, cook one clove of chopped garlic in a HUGE amount of Mammarella Basil Grapeseed oil (1/4 cup), add the Pomodoro-Basilico sauce, melt in 4 ounces of cubed mozzarella cheese, season with salt and pepper.  Not exactly what I would call an innovative recipe.  Certainly not anything special to be included with this gift, especially if you are sending it to someone.<br /><br />The packaging is all in greens, browns and other earth colors, probably to signify organic to the consumer's eye and brain.  The entire colander was filled with balled up paper or the zig-zag cut brown paper filler with all the items then arranged on top.  The whole thing is encased in shrink clear plastic wrap.  The bow is two strands of the very narrow paper ribbon.  I tried to "pouff" the bow up to make it look pretty but had no luck.  It is simply too narrow to have any fluff in it.<br /><br />Would I send this as a gift basket to a friend?  Definitely not.  For this price it is simply much too expensive for what you get.  The Francis Coppola name does not make up for the high price.  The sauce was good and the bumbola pasta was fun to look at and it held a lot of sauce.  Otherwise I think it is overpriced and underwhelming.
