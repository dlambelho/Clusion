PORT SALUT ABBEY is truly scrumptious cheese! (Yum!).  I first got acquainted with Port Salut cheese years ago, when I was a member of "CheeseLovers International".  There, I not only bought delicious cheeses, but also became familiar with the term "tyrophile", which means "cheese-lover".  That certainly is one very accurate description of me!<br /><br />I not only became acquainted with Port Salut cheese, but also Royal Harvarti cheese -- both for the first time, via C.I.  I've had other Havarti cheese since, (no "royal Harvarti" could I find) -- and found it not to be as good as the Royal Havarti from the CheeseLovers International club.  However, this PORT SALUT ABBEY is every bit as good as the Port Salut I got from C.I. -- and even better!<br /><br />Although Port Salut does not list "wine" as one of its ingredients, it does have the slight, but distinctive taste of port wine.  "Wispride" and other cheese spreads have a port-wine version....and, though the winey flavour in Port Salut cheese is definitely present, (even without any wine being listed in the ingredients), it is much less strong than in the Wispride, or other port-wine cheese spread varieties.<br /><br />Slightly sweet, with tiniest hint of an egg-creme taste, (again, without egg-cream being listed on the label), Port Salut is a superb cheese for any and all occasions!<br /><br />This Port Salut Abbey Cheese was even better than the Port Salut cheese I bought from Cheeselovers International, because it was much creamier --and probably fresher, as well.<br /><br />I give this cheese only four stars, (although the TASTE merits ten -- if not 196 stars.  That's one for each year since Port Salut was invented, according to the label, which says, "Depuis 1819", for this French-made, pasteurized cheese.<br /><br />The reason for only four stars is this: The weight of this cheese is listed as 5 pounds here on Amazon.  The carton it comes in, (wonderfully sdecure, and also wonderfully easy to open! : ) says it weighs 4.99 pounds.  However, on the cheese itself, the weight is listed as only 4 3/4 pounds!  This prompts a rhyme from me,<br />that goes:  "Nibble?  Who is nibbling, please?  Don't take ounces off my cheese?"<br /><br />This is NOT to infer that any entity, (mouse, human, or whatever), has been "nibbling" at this cheese -- only to wonder at the short-weighing of this cheese.  In these days of high food prices, (and higher shipping rates), every ounce counts!<br /><br />I bought the 5 pound wheel, (or what I thought was a 5 pound wheel), precisely because of the higher shipping rates for smaller wheels.  In fact, I bought THREE 5-pound wheels for this very reason: Three-five pound wheels, (with shipping costs), bring the price down from approximately $17 per pound, to $14 per pound.<br />Of course, this has to be recalculated if the wheel is not 5 pounds, but only 4 and 3/4 pounds.  Still, this is a LOT better than the one-pound wheel, which, with shippping costs, comes out to an astonishing $23.00 a pound!<br /><br />Today, people are looking for bargains -- even in luxury goods.  (At least I am.)<br />I have, in fact, put a 15 pound wheel of Swiss cheese on my wish list.  It is not presently available, and perhaps never will be...but I have cast my vote here, for buying in bulk and saving money!  I see here that only four more 5-pound wheels are presently available -- and hope, fervently, that this does not mean the end of the 5-pound, (or even 4 3/4 pound), wheel!  Fourteen dollars a pound is a lot to pay -- but compared to $23 a pound, it is a positive bargain!  I respectfully suggest that five-pound wheels continue to be sold, for economy's -- (and sales!) -- sake(s).  Perhaps to make this delicious cheese even more tempting, a SLIGHTLY higher price could be charged for buying 5 1-pound wheels, together. Slightly higher than the price for a whole 5 pound wheel -- but much less, hopefully, than five one-poound wheels bought singly.<br /><br />This is truly SCRUMPTIOUS cheese.  For those who do not drink wine, (or who do not want to drink wine every time they eat this cheese....yet DO want something to drink with it), I would like to suggest drinking BLACK TEA, or COLA with it!  The<br />Tea -- and especially Cola -- might seem to be slightly, er....plebian...when drunk with this gourmet cheese.  But remember, no one is really "above it all",<br />that just about EVERYONE has eaten fast-food fare, that "nice guys" not only usually win, but also sleep better at night, that "being one of the people" is guaranteed to win more votes......and that cheese -- any cheese -- tastes quite GOOD when accompanied by drinking tea and/or cola!<br /><br />Eating Port Salut cheese is something everyone should have a chance to do -- even if only once in their lives.  Bon Appetite!  : ),
