This bar is somewhat akin to being a kind of ~'chocolatized fig newton interior', albeit one in which the fig component is 100% fig (though isn't 'gritty' in places the way the interior of a fig newton is).<br /><br />Just minutes ago, I finished eating my first bar of this.<br /><br />An important distinction to make is that the name of the product (& which is found on the product packaging of each individual bar) states "Fig Bar with Dark Chocolate" -- i.e. WITH -- but the Product Description online states "Fig covered in dark chocolate" -- which gives the errant impression that this bar is a slab of fig interior, with a dark chocolate exterior, which is NOT the case.<br /><br />The fig & dark chocolate components have been mixed together -- however, when one tastes this, it's almost as though the fig & dark chocolate 'take turns' with your tastebuds -- even though there is definitely an initial fig+dark_chocolate_together overall taste, as I chewed each bite, there was a sort of alternating aspect to which of the components I was tasting in any given split second (somewhat as though hearing a duet being sung by 2 singers, & simultaneously being able to register individual voices & ~'harmonies' [when it comes to the tastes which involve contributions of both the fig & dark chocolate]).<br /><br />It might seem strange to utilize a singing/duet -type analogy, but honestly, I was a bit surprised by how the fig aspect would suddenly 'register' with my tastebuds, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' the dark chocolate, & then a split second later, I was 'registering' both -- it was like different distinct aspects of the respective primary ingredients were still 'standing their ground' despite being part of a mix -- i.e. the 'what makes a fig taste like a fig' aspect wasn't 'crushed' in the process of the smushed figs being mixed with dark chocolate -- & so there's a kind of interestingly multidimensional taste to this.<br /><br />Also, to clarify, the chocolate taste is definitely one of dark chocolate -- i.e. it isn't the 'sweet' taste associated with other kinds of chocolate (it's sweeter than unsweetened chocolate, but this bar would not end up confusing anyone doing a taste test, as to whether it was any kind of 'candy bar' -- this bar tastes like what it's advertised to be -- fig with dark chocolate, period).<br /><br />The ingredient listing on the individual bar's packaging states that these bars are 90% fig & 10% dark chocolate.  The 'how much fig to be mixed with how much dark chocolate' ratio that has been used with the product seems to accomplish what the manufacturer likely set out to do -- i.e. allow the consumer to enjoy *both* tastes, & not have any one taste 'overpower' the other.<br /><br />Texture-wise, this is very much like the Oskri 100% fig bar, but has a slightly more firm texture due to the presence of the dark chocolate.<br /><br />The nutrition profile of a 1.9 oz bar (per what is on an individual bar's packaging) =<br />Calories : 60<br /><br />Total Fat : 2 g<br />Saturated Fat : 1g<br />Trans Fat: 0g<br />Cholesterol: 0mg<br />Sodium: 0mg<br /><br />Total Carb : 13g<br />Fiber : 2g<br />Sugars : 11g<br />Protein : 1g<br /><br />The ingredient profile =<br />Figs 90%<br />Dark chocolate 10% (sugar, chocolate liquor, cocoa butter, soy lecithin, natural vanilla)<br /><br />The product packaging conveys that the product is Vegan, Lactose Free, Gluten Free, & Kosher.<br /><br />Consistent with the minimal ingredient mix associated with this bar's composition, one does not taste anything else -- this bar tastes like fig with dark chocolate, & that's it -- no artificial whatnot interfering with the taste or nutrition.<br /><br />Lastly, & this might sound strange, but something I find appealing about the Oskri fig with dark chocolate bar & the Oskri 100% fig bar is that they are an easy, convenient, conveniently sized & indirectly ~portion-controlled, & shelf-life-stable-for-over-a-year (the bar I just ate was manufactured in Feb 2012 & has an expiration date of August 2013) way to obtain (& keep on hand) an atypical ingredient for baking -- or for an ad hoc addition to or topping for various baked goods (& the 100% fig bar, in particular, but also this bar, to an extent [though especially if heated slightly] could be relatively easily spread atop either toast, bagels, or various breads, or various confectionary items [& specifically, those which wouldn't 'fall apart' if something were spread on with slight pressure]).<br /><br />This is an interesting taste, & a not-so-easy-to-find ingredient mix (at least in my experience, & especially in such an unadulterated form [this stuff is 'pure & simple', & without food additives]), & while the manufacturer of the product might not have intended this type of use (as a baked goods add-on/mix-in, or as an alternative to ~jelly or cream cheese), it's something I can't help finding the product readily useful for & utterly compatible with.  And truth be told, after eating one bar, I think I'd actually prefer to have a little something 'with' the fig & dark chocolate -- but I'm glad that the manufacturer didn't include it (or in any way render a new form of fig newton) -- I like the fact that I have the option of pairing this with whatever baked-type base or ~wrap-around form of baked whateverness I so choose...<br /><br />Additionally, given the fig/fruit component, & even with the presence of dark chocolate in this particular bar (versus the Oskri 100% fig bar), the next 'frontier' of food pairing that crosses my mind for these Oskri fig bars, is to try them with pears, &/or blue cheese, &/or proscuitto (& with the 'ultimate' being proscuitto-wrapped figs & blue cheese [I can't help but think that I'll also try it with the dark chocolate-ized version, as well, just to see what it tastes like :) ]).  Basically, anything one might find compatible with figs, I would venture to try with cut up pieces of or a mashed version of an Oskri fig bar (of one kind or the other).  Who knows... this fig with dark chocolate product might end up being a part of my next homerun hors d'oeuvre (I'm already imagining what pieces of it might taste like wrapped in bacon [that possibility has just leapfrogged all others as the gotta-try-it-first pairing :) (& after that, bacon-wrapped fig & dark chocolate with blue cheese)])...<br /><br />I'm glad that this product is available, & look forward to 'experimenting' with whatever add-on/mix-in -type pairings turn out to be a fun & interesting way to enjoy this readily accessible & conveniently mixable/mashable/moldable form of fig.
