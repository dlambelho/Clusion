Nature's One deleted my post from their Facebook page so I am posting my doctors recommendations here.<br /><br />If there is any question whether this company is hiding something it was quickly answered after they deleted my post in which I described recommendations that I received from the toxicologists at Environmental Health Sciences at Children's Hospital in Boston, MA.  This department specifically deals with public health issues regarding environmental toxins so I believe their opinions are less biased than that of Natures One or their "independent researchers."<br /><br />Anyway, I have been feeding my baby this formula since she was born 5 months ago.  I was concerned after hearing the news report regarding the levels of inorganic arsenic in the brown rice syrup so I called my local pediatrician who recommended that I call Children's Hospital.  The toxicologist recommended that I stop using any formula that contains brown rice syrup as its principal ingredient along with any other baby food products with it until they have more information. He mentioned the Dartmouth study stating the brown rice syrup has well over the recommended amount of inorganic arsenic, about 6x times past the limit.<br /><br />It was a relief to hear from the toxicologist that I need not worry about any acute or chronic arsenic toxicity for my baby, and that she does not require any urine, blood or hair tests.  This is in contrast to what many other pediatricians have recommended for their parents who are feeding their children the same formula.  The toxicologist believes that my daughter's risks to developing any illness, cancer etc was less than 1% greater than a child who had not been given the formula, so that was very reassuring.<br /><br />After hearing these recommendations from Children's Hospital I could see how someone would still continue using the Natures One product because the health risks are low, however I opted to switch because I realize my role as a parent is to reduce any risks to my child, even if it is less than 1%. There are so many other chemical risks out there that I feel any risks that you can take off the table would help protect my child because it is probably the cumulative effect off all these chemicals that leads to adverse problems. And i figure if those people who have a Masters in Public Health are recommending to discontinue it who am I to disagree with them.<br /><br />An ethical company would have taken the Dartmouth study information and told the public that they will try to improve on their product, ie. reduce the inorganic arsenic, however, they still claim they make the finest baby formula out there.  Their website says they are looking out for the health of our children but refuse to recall or change their product which speaks for itself.<br /><br />In light of them deleting my post above from their Facebook page, it appears that they definitely have something to hide, as I was just posting public health information that I felt people in my situation would like to know given to me by one of the most reputable health institutions (Children's Hospital) in the world.<br /><br />Obviously, I would give this product zero stars if I could.  Hope this info helps some of those confused, concerned parents out there like me.<br /><br />UPDATE #1*** please read the article from the Huffington Post written Dr. Gary Ginsberg, a toxicologist from Yale.  It is in line with the recommendations from Children's Hospital of Boston.<br /><br />UPDATE #2*** I received a response from Dr. Gary Ginsburg in response to the new testing results by Nature's One.  Looks like their testing results indicate an even worse situation than originally thought.  Here is the response from Dr. Ginsburg: "Seeing your comment made me hopeful that this is just lab error, a false alarm. However, saying that Dartmouth doesn't know how to measure arsenic is like saying Roger Federer doesn't know how to play tennis. The Nature's One press release sounded scientific - they explain how the Dartmouth analysis was different from their method and why theirs was better. But when you click on their own results - in 3 samples of their baby formula, the inorganic arsenic is actually greater (53 to 83 ppb) than the Dartmouth results (10-20 ppb)!! So calling the Dartmouth results too high and flawed is an insult to Dartmouth as well as to all of us. Further, they compare their results to an outmoded WHO (CODEX) arsenic acceptable intake of 2.1 ug/kg/d. This was withdrawn in the latest CODEX because it was too close to the cancer effect level and CODEX did not supply a new value. Nature One claims that Dartmouth relied on the 2.1 ug/kg/d value but in fact Dartmouth used 0.3 ug/kg/d (the dose corresponding to USEPA's drinking water std) to compare against. If Nat1 used that target, their baby formula would be in the danger zone, so they chose the withdrawn target instead. The bottom line is that the company's own data make the situation worse, with levels of arsenic in their baby formula 5 to 8 times greater than the USEPA drinking water standard for inorganic arsenic (10 ppb)."
