My two Himalayans have been using Swheat Scoop for about three years now and it definitely has some pros and cons.  I truly do not think there is such thing as the perfect cat litter and you just have to decide which product is the best for you and your kitties.<br /><br />I was using Fresh Step and was worried about the chemicals and clay dust.  My cats are pretty easy going and will use anything I put out for them.  I didn't start them off slowly or mix cat litters. Instead I changed one box (I have two) to the Swheat Scoop to see if they'd go for it and they began using it immediately<br /><br />I am not nearly as diligent as I should be about cleaning the box. My cats are not siblings but they do the same exact things in the cat box (maybe it's the breed). Neither one will cover up what they do. This is kind of gross but the turds sit on top unless I go in and cover them. Thankfully they aren't super stinky so that's not really a problem for me. If I cover up the turds the litter doesn't really stick to it, it just sort of dries it out a bit. When I go to scoop them out, not much cat litter comes with them. They're like little rocks that I fish out.<br /><br />My cats also like to wee in the same spot on top of each other's pee. This is drawback number one. They never pee in the middle of the box, it's always right up against the side. They'll do it so much that it doesn't really clump but turns into a wet mushy mess. The loose clumps break apart easily and you really can't use a slotted scoop to get them out. I have a little plastic shovel it use to remove it. This is only when i let the cat box go for a few days. Every once in a while I have the opposite problem. They'll surprise me and go on the far side of the box and when I go to scoop it's like other reviewers have said, like wet cement. You almost have to chisel it off.<br /><br />Now on the odor control I have two issues.  If I don't clean as often as I should, there can be a strong ammonia odor after two or three days. It's a make your eyes water, burn your eyebrows off kind of smell. Mind you my cats pee in the same spot so my guess is that the litter can't really handle that. I tried the multi cat formula with the same results. It can be very bad and makes the task of cleaning the litterbox that much more unpleasant. I originally thought there was something wrong with my cats but my vet assured me they had no problems. The fix is to scoop every day and maybe several times a day. The other issue I have with the odor is probably more a mental thing for me. If I clean the box diligently (before the ammonia smell sets in) the cat box smells like Cheetos (the orange puffed cheese snack). It's very weird and has put me right off eating them (the Cheetos, not the litter). I would imagine it's because of the starch in the litter but I find it rather strange.<br /><br />The price is pretty reasonable. I buy the 14-17 lb. bags from PetsMart and it ranges in price from $9.99-11.99 depending on if I catch a sale. I live in the DC metro area so not sure if this is comparable to other areas. They sell a 40 lb bag but I'm a weakling and can't lift it by myself. This stuff is heavy. It's lighter than clay but still heavy. I like the 17 lb bags the best but they only have those sporadically.  I find the the 17 lb bag fills up my very large cat box nicely.  Or, one bag 14 lb plus a bit more will do the trick.  I can get it to last about one month before emptying, bleaching and refilling the box.<br /><br />This stuff tracks pretty badly but I've never had a scoopable cat litter that didn't. I sweep/vacuum it up daily which cuts down on some of the tracking. It's not fun to walk on since it's hard but it cleans up pretty easily. My box is in the bathroom so I probably track it more than my cats do.<br /><br />You can flush it but I don't do that since my toilet is low flow and clogs occasionally. I dispose of it in the trash. It's a little dusty when you first pour it into the cat box but not once it's in there.<br /><br />I did get a bag with bugs in it a while back and I didn't realize what they were or put two and two together. After reading other reviews I gather they were the wheat weevils. As soon as I saw the bugs I emptied the cat box, swept up the mess and used a fresh bag. Didn't have a problem with bugs after that.<br /><br />Overall this is a good product but don't expect perfection. For the price I feel like it's a good fit for me. My cats seem to like it, it's natural so I don't have to worry about them ingesting toxins and it cleans up pretty well if I stay on top of it. The price is reasonable and I can find it at some grocery stores now. I would reccommend trying it and seeing how you like it.
