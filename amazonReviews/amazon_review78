We tried this recently. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />First off, I am allergic to aspartame, so most of the great flavors of drink mixes out there are<br />already off my radar.  After living in a place with nasty ol' well water for a few years, I developed<br />a soda habit that I am trying to break. I've tried plain tea, don't care much for it, so looked for<br />a decent flavored tea that I didn't have to boil water for (partially disabled, and no stove, etc<br />where I am most of the time).<br /><br />Last time at the store, I saw these. The package is a little deceptive, so be aware!<br />That "five calories" is not even for one whole bottle of water - it is for HALF of a bottle of water<br />with ONE packet mixed in! I guess they didn't want to post double-digits of a whopping ten calories,<br />but that's what it is for one packet.<br /><br />The sweeteners are THREE KINDS - Honey, Sugar AND Sucralose. Why they needed three, I do not know.<br />It actually ends up being a little too sweet. I make it, them dilute it with more water than<br />it technically needs.<br /><br />Not sure why Lipton can't just make something ALL natural, or use stevia, which has no effect on<br />blood glucose. They seem to be hesitant to use it for some reason, but I don't know why. They have no<br />problems loading up the other drinks with chemical sweeteners, but avoid stevia!  Weird...<br /><br />I have had a lot of problems with my throat swelling up this week, but I have been sick. I am not sure<br />if it is related to the illness, or because I've been drinking this tea almost exclusively for the last<br />few days. Aspartame makes my mouth, tongue and throat swell up, which is why I read every label now.<br />Not sure if the sucralose is doing anything or not - I would tend to think not, because my lips are not<br />numb nor is my tongue swollen. Still, I'd avoid the sucralose if I could.<br /><br />The flavor is really sweet, but I like it. It is refreshing and tasty. Again, a little too sweet for my<br />personal tastes, so I "water" it down with lots of ice, and it makes it very good!<br />It's worth trying. This is the only flavor we've tried so far, but will definitely give the others a shot<br />as well. If it helps me give up soda, then that's even better! : )<br /><br />UPDATE JULY 9, 2012:<br /><br />Well, it has been incredibly hot here in the midwest, with a heat wave that broke all kinds of records.<br />Of course, I was drinking a lot of tea. These packets are 10 calories each (that "5 calories" on the box refers to HALF<br />of one packet!), and I had either one or two packets each day for the last month, perhaps.<br />We also tried the peach flavor now, and I don't care for it, but my husband and son like it better than this one.<br /><br />I had to come back and add to the review because of something kind of odd. Now, I am hypoglycemic, so maybe that is part of it,<br />but I have to mention it in case others have this problem. I got this tea originally to help me get away from my Pepsi habit.<br />The 24-oz bottles of Pepsi that I buy have 300 calories in the bottle. I make the tea kind of weak, so one packet actually makes closer to 32 ounces of liquid for me - I like the flavor better that way (just personal preference), so by comparison, I am getting just 10 calories for 32 oz, vs the 300 in the 24-oz Pepsi. Savings of about 97% of the calories, which should be a good thing!<br /><br />Here's the kicker - I have been GAINING WEIGHT since I changed over to the tea! Nothing else has changed. I didn't suddenly<br />take up eating endlessly, etc, and in fact, have eaten a little less during this heat wave. I put on almost five pounds in the last few weeks of changing over to this tea. Now, from a caloric standpoint, it doesn't seem possible. However, I am one of those people who does much better on high-protein, low-carb. If you have a similar type of metabolism/body, then be aware of these little packets!  I think it might be the honey in them creating a non-stop (because I sip tea all day long to keep cool) assault on my blood sugars. I've noticed that I feel hungry more often as well too. I normally don't get all that hungry - just have a few hungry days once in a while. With this tea, it almost gives you the munchies. I haven't indulged, so it isn't from extra food. It has to be the tea.<br /><br />Again, I have to say that I don't think that everyone will experience this effect, but wanted to bring it up.<br />I think the combo of the THREE sugars Lipton has chosen to use for reasons unknown are having a negative effect for me personally.<br />I still like the tea, but have now been cutting it down even more, to see if I can lessen the effects of the sweeteners.<br />I find it odd to think that I could cut out 590 calories a day (I usually drank two of those 24-oz pepsis! Yes, I was bad...) and GAIN weight. It has to be the way all those sugars are interacting with my system.<br /><br />So, if you are one of those folks who do really well on a low-carb diet, be aware that this tea could cause you to lose progress, or even cause you to gain weight. I have also warned my husband, who tends towards higher blood glucose, to only drink it with meals, never alone like I do.  Just an important heads-up on what could have been the best thing to happen to tea in a long, long time.<br /><br />Lipton - please try making something with stevia, which has no impact on blood glucose levels and has no calories. Why put sucralose into your items, when stevia is so much better?  I don't get it - it can't be that much cheaper to use! And I'd pay more for an item that used stevia... what a shame!
