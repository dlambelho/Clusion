This is one of the most heartful, hearty presentations of a healing comfort food I can imagine eating [definitely slurping with glee]... though I have one issue with it which won't immediately bother others as it unfortunately will me. I'll attempt to explain...<br /><br />My Aunt Mary's homemade lentil soup, saged and simmered with near religious grace at the opening of each new year, was beyond description, so when I saw this canned soup my soul drooled in thanks!<br /><br />Reading the ingredients noted on the buying page, I was thrilled that the soup was composed not only of organic lentils, but with a list of organic ingredients which to me, well versed in herbs for heavy healing as well as high flavor, read like a literal Godsend for my needs for delicious sustenance. Even the label reeked with super yummy culinary art. I couldn't wait to get my hands [and taste buds] on that concoction.<br /><br />The unfortunate part for me is that when the can arrived in good time and condition, and was in hand; I read the ingredients. Indeed each on the list was certified organic. That to me means no GMO's, no genetic modification of any type, nor excess additives are involved within the product. The unfortunate part for me was that "organic" soy was included as one of the beans in the soup.<br /><br />I need to stay away from any type of soy, as much as possible, and I honestly have a hard time believing that any type of soy these days could be called organic, especially in the sense of having no GMO or genetic modification. But, even if there is such a thing as a truly organic soybean, I would still be compromised by other aspects of that seed's purpose, which, according to some scientists, was not intended to be a human food.<br /><br />If you want to background on this, feel free to read THE DARK SIDE OF CINDERELLA by Dr.s Mary Enig and Sally Fallon. That article can be read on Dr. Mercola's web site.<br /><br />A larger part of this "Why NO SOY for me" is that I've had a magnesium deficiency and liver debilitation for most (if not all) of my life. That deficiency and debilitation means that I am much more vulnerable... [having shown symptoms earlier and and with more serious and varied consequences which are not only severely painful but life threatening and accelerating of aging ailments]... than the general population would be, to the toxic and mineral blocking facets of soy, along with its estrogen effect being forced into overdose, due to the predominance of soy products [included as ingredients in other foods] having been pushed into the food marketplace so many ways since the 60's [see above article for background].<br /><br />Even if not for the health difficulties I've suffered from soy products being included in so many foods for decades [I'll turn 63 this year] through various ways; I can't stand the taste or smell of soy, except in fermented soy sauce, or except when it is dramatically masked or enhanced.<br /><br />This won't be an issue to those who believe soy is a healthy vegetable if produced by organic restrictions, or even if it's produced with GMO scientific enhancement. And the other ingredients and the caring way this product has been produced and presented would indeed be akin to God Food, IMO. That is why I'm giving this product a 5 star rating.<br /><br />For those who seek organic presentations and organic soy, this soup would indeed be a product of highest appeal.<br /><br />But I needed to include the warning about its soy presence, for those like me who might already be limited by soy related allergies, intolerances, or debilitations; or who would like to be informed on the buying page ingredients notations that soybeans are included in this otherwise richly luxurious soup.<br /><br />I wish there were someone young and healthy who likes soy to give the two cans I purchased with joyful anticipation.  I don't dare eat it, even though many foods I get at the grocery store and restaurants are impregnated with soy or cooked in soybean oil. So, what's one more soybean?<br /><br />The point is that I've been gradually building a stock of 100% certified organic, no soy foods, focusing these cautious purchases from a level of health and survival at risk. I would not have guessed that this type of soup would have added soybeans to its recipe.  It represents to me a food with an historic and near religious significance from a cultural soul-set which would have been inimical to adding soybeans to its long revered ingredients. [See the article noted above if you want to know what the ancient Orientals believed about the soybean seed; I would have been honored to eat their revered foods.]<br /><br />All the issues for me could be remedied if soybeans would have been disclosed on the buying page as an ingredient.<br /><br />Each of the other ingredients were listed. Why not mention the soy?<br /><br />What hurts me most is I was SO looking forward to slurping that soup! I honestly envy those who would be able to comfortably enjoy it as it is, with soy.<br /><br />With respect to those who believe soy is a true nutrient, I apologize and have no desire for your choice for soy products to be limited in the marketplace. Even if those who believe soy is potentially harmful with long-term input are wrong, I want the presence of this [IMO] toxic anti-nutrient to be clearly disclosed, especially since so few products in the marketplace are free of its presence.<br /><br />I'm still hungry for a truly organic soup precisely like this one, with NO soy of any kind, but thankful that I still have a yummy good supply of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PH0">Wolfgang Puck Organic Creamy Tomato Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PGG">Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Egg Noodles Soup, 14.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 12)</a>.<br /><br />I have a growing stock, purchased from Amazon, of the type of organic presentations I need, and hope to be able to review those, but health issues are making my supply of reserves at low ebb indeed. Thankfully, many products available on Amazon are clearly marked for ingredients, so most of us can find what we want or need, by preference or necessity.<br /><br />Thank you very much, Amazon sellers who give a clear, full disclosure of ingredients,<br />Linda Shelnutt
