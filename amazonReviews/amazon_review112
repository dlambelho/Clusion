Updated 9/7/12: The product being sold as White Chia Seed by Nutiva "CHIA seed" is a new variety of Salvia Hispanica seed selected by growers to produce only white seeds.  It is just as good for you as the nurtitional powerhouse  that is marketed as "Black Chia" which has become a common offering as a health food as well as the seeds that grow furry looking Chia pets!.  White Chia Seeds come from the the same species of plant, just a different cultivar.  The Protein, oil and fatty acid profiles are basically the same  as any black Chia grown in the same climate.  there is no appreciable difference.  The white or light color of these seeds make them easier to incorporate into smoothies and porridges when you add them to water to form the filling and nutritious gel that is described on the back of the package.  I don't mind the Gel form and find it helpful and filling when added to a banana-berry smoothie with only a little bit of agave syrup for sweetener.  The gel holds up well and I don't get that unpleasant bitter taste I associate with flax-seed or Flax meal.  So I'm already thrilled with the White Chia as a substitute for Flax & will be using the 15% Subscribe & Save option to make this an even better buy for my family in the future.<br /><br />Where I see this being even more useful is lightly dry-toasted and added to salads or atop cold cereal and we've had some success with that.  My husband has also been adding the toasted White Chia to a snack mix he makes of grated bittersweet chocolate, All-Bran cereal and a variety of Chex cereals for what he calls his "sweet snack" of the day.  Since it's a dry mixture with just a little bit of Cinnamon and allspice added, it doesn't gel up once it's toasted and it adds more fiber to an already better snack choice.  The other possible benefit is that when using the gel as a thickener insteadof wheat flour Rue, you can feed the suaces and gravies to Celiac patients since there is no Gluten in Salvia Hspanica seeds.  Another Win/Win!<br /><br />I was quite curious about the so-called "White Chia"  and it took me some extra research to finally peg the source as being this new cultivar and not a similar but different species because Nutiva doesn't list the species on the label as do other sellers of White Chia.  In the process I learned a great deal about just how healthy this product is!  Nutritionally speaking, it's main benefits seem to be from the soluble plant-based fiber and the small amounts of protein and Omega-3 you get with each recommended serving of 1 Tbsp.  I would suggest starting slowly before you increase your daily intake any higher becuase you will have an increase in bowel frequency , volume (larger) and texture (softer) the more of this you eat.  For most of us, this is a desired outcome and why we choose to add a supplement like Chia or Flax to our diets but for people with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Diverticulitis or other Bowel disorders, please discuss this with either your Gastroenterologist or regular Primary Care Physician before adding to your diet.  You might have some sudden changes that you can't predict.  For healthy people, just take it slowly until you find the correct amount to keep you regular, and also provide that feeling of stomach fullness that the Chia Gel can provide.<br /><br />Even if you have chronic health problems, don't turn away from Chia Seeds out of fear!  There are good books and resources that can guide you if you wish to try and work this into a healthy eating plan.  For example, many diabetics use Chia Gel to help them feel full.  This book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1605296759">Diabetes Without Drugs: The 5-Step Program to Control Blood Sugar Naturally and Prevent Diabetes Complications</a>, has a good recipe for a filling Almond bread using Chia seeds of either color.  Another good book about Chia seeds and their possible benefits is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0816524882">Chia: Rediscovering a Forgotten Crop of the Aztecs</a>.  Remember, however, to always clear the addition of a new fiber source with your doctor , in the event that fiber has been a problem for you in the past.  Also, Diabetics should always test-drive new foods by checking their blood sugar before and after consuming itthe new food, at the intervals your educator recommends or what you have come to know is your impact time. The Calories per serving are 60 with calories from fat coming in at 20, sugars 0 but total Carbs at 5 grams.  I would treat this as both a source of fat and fiber and adjust accordingly.<br /><br />Our overall experience with this has been great and I will update this after we have been consuming this regularly for a few more months.  The cost is comperable to Flaxmeal and yet the product is gentler on the digestive system and has no bad fatertaste.  We love it!  It's been a good experience and one we might not have chosen over our Flaxmeal from thelocal Trader Joe's had it not been for the ease of ordering via Amazon.  I hope Nutiva expands their offerings thru Amazon.<br /><br />Now that we've been using White Chia for a while, we have stopped using the strong tasting flax meal completely and now use White Chia in its place.  We're very happy with the products ease of use and  the many foods to which it can be easily added for extra nutritional benefits.  We love it  and we're sold on it!
