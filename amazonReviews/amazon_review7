WITH SHIPPING, (AND HANDLING!), THE COST OF THIS ARROWHEAD DISTILLED WATER COMES TO $14.005 PER GALLON!  This price is even hard for luxury-loving me to swallow!  Especially as there is a way to make distilled water, (even without a water-distiller!) for just about no cost at all!<br /><br />Please note that I am NOT here singling out Arrowhead Distilled water as being over-priced.  It just happened to come up first on the list of ready-made distilled water, here at Amazon.  I'm sure that it, (and all the other ready-made distilled waters being sold), is tasty and healthy, (and convenient!) distilled water.  However, it is WOEFULLY OVER-PRICED.  My review here is for ALL ready-to-drink, distilled waters, offered on Amazon, (and elsewhere), at such ridiculous prices.<br /><br />HOW can one make distilled water far more cheaply -- and without a<br />water-distiller?  By employing a method known as "home-distillation".<br />(This has NOTHING whatsoever to do with home distillation of whisky, of course.  It is for home-distillation of WATER.  Nothing illegal here, (yet, anyway!)  Copper kettles, copper coils, and new-made cornmash are NOT required, or used here!<br /><br />What IS used?  Large, (gallon size, if possible), glass jars.  The type in which organic apple juice often is seen.  What to do:  After washing out the bottle thoroughly, (and or, after previously drinking up all of the delicious organic apple juice), rinse jar throughly, to be sure no soap is left in the jar.  Rinse first with hot water, then, very slowly, (so as not to have an abrupt temperature change that can crack the glass), decrease the amount of hot water, and increase the amount of cold water used to rinse out the jar.  When 100% cold water is flowing from the faucet into the jar, keep rinsing<br />jar for another minute.  Finally, empty the jar, and fill with 100% cold(est) water.  Lightly cover with a PLASTIC cap, as metal caps tend to get rusty after a while.  (I find that different top colours from gallon-sized jugs of milk are perfect for this: gradually build up a collection of red, orange, green, white, and other colour milk-gallon tops, from whole, nonfat, and other types of milk.  Caps from bottles of products such as ENSURE, and PEDIA-SURE, are also good for<br />lightly covering these gallon milk containers, filled now as they are with home-distilled-water-in-the-making.)<br /><br />Fill up as many of these empty gallon glass containers as you can, (and for which you have room on your kitchen counter, or elsewhere), waiting at least an hour before you fill each jug in sequence, using a different colour top for each one.<br /><br />Get some magnets, and place them in a handy place -- like on your refrigerator door.  Take some small pieces of paper, and write the colour of each top/cover, on them.  Attach the pieces of paper to your refrigerator door, (or other handy place).  Line the pieces of paper up in a row, with the colour of the cover of the first jug you fill first, the colour of the colour of the top of the second jug you fill second, and so on.<br /><br />Now, just wait at least 10 hours from the time you fill the first jug.  When you want some distilled water, simply pour it into the saucepan / goldfish bowl, or wherever else you want to use your home-distilled water.  DO NOT USE MORE THAN HALF OF THE CONTENTS OF EACH JAR!  The secret of home-distilled water, you see, is that all of the flouride, and other things that are put into tap water, that you do not want, (and are the reason you buy or make distilled water in the first place), will, during the 10 or more hours you are waiting, sink down to the bottom of the bottle, as they are heavier than the water!<br />I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU BOIL THE WATER IMMEDIATELY AFTER YOU HAVE DISTILLED IT, HOWEVER -- AT LEAST TWO FULL MINUTES ON A FULL BOIL.  BECAUSE "STANDING WATER" CAN GET STALE, (AND PROBABLY DANGEROUS), IF YOU LEAVE IT OUT TOO LONG WITHOUT REFRIGERATION.)  Of course, if you have a HUGE refrigerator, you can probably put the distilled water into it immediately after filling the jugs, and reduce, or eliminate, the boiling time otherwise required.  If you must boil the water, and want COOL distilled water, just turn the gas or electric stove off after the required two minutes, and wait until the water has cooled.<br /><br />When you finish using the first bottle of distilled water, rinse it out again with hot, then ever-so-slowly, cooler -- then cold water.<br />Move the paper attached to the refrigerator with the magnet, signifying the first bottle, (say, with the word "blue" on the paper -- signifying that the first bottle has a blue cap on it), to the end of the row.  Now, take the paper attached by a magnet signifying the second bottle, (say, with the word "yellow" written on it, meaning the yellow-capped bottle), to the "head of the line" of pieces of paper attached by magnets, on your refrigerator.  And so on.  This way, you need only move the papers attached by magnets, on your refrigerator, and not the bottles themselves, to always know which bottle has been sitting out the longest, (and hence has the most distillation at the moment.)  Lifting these little papers-attached-by-magnets-to-the-refrigerator, and moving them around, to different places in the line on your refrigerator, is a whole lot easier than always lifting, and repositioning the gallon-size glass jars on your kitchen counter!<br /><br />In any event, you will now have pure, home-distilled water!  The longer you let the water remain in the jugs, the more distilled the water will be.  The less you take out of each jug, the more distilled the water will be.<br /><br />NOTE: DISTILLING WATER, BY ANY METHOD, WILL ALSO ELIMINATE NEEDED MINERALS FROM THE WATER.  Because minerals -- along with flouride and other contaminates your well-meaning city water system puts into city water -- are also heavier than the water.  SO, IF YOU DRINK DISTILLED WATER, FROM ANY SOURCE, BE SURE TO ALSO TAKE MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS!<br /><br />This SOUNDS like a very, very complicated process -- but read it a few times, and you will see how actually very, very simple it is.  You get another bonus when boiling the distilled water -- it takes LESS TIME TO BOIL, AND WILL BOIL MORE THROUGHLY, because the floride, minerals, and other things have been removed from the water.  It's like the difference between boiling water that has pebbles in it, and water that doesn't have pebbles in it.  Because these "extra-aqualar" particles -- minerals, flouride, etc. -- are just that: tiny, microscopic "pebbles".<br /><br />Line up as many gallon jugs as you can find and have room for, (I have 8).  Have fun and save money with your home-distilled water.  It will cost ONLY the price of your water-bill!
