I am what might be called a "lazy cook".  Most recipes totally<br />faize me, and the clean-up afterwards, (what with a broken<br />dishwasher in my home at present), makes the idea of creaing<br />meals for myself even more distasteful.<br /><br />But ravioli?  Like other pasta dishes, it's even easy for ME<br />to prepare.  1) Put frozen ravioli, (or other pasta product,<br />into a Pasta Express or other large container which has a<br />lid. (I like using 32 ounce zip-lock containers.)  2) Pour<br />boiling water into said container, to cover ravioli or other<br />pasta product, and more, stopping at about 1/2 inch from lid.<br />3) Cover container.  (If using a zip-lock container, leave<br />one of the four locking corners OPEN.  Or two of the locking<br />corners open -- slightly.)  3) Wait 45 minutes to an hour,<br />or until most if not all of the water is absorbed by the<br />ravioli or other pasta product.  4) Drain away excess water.<br />5) Put into dish, and cover with desired sauce, and cheese,<br />if any.....<br /><br />Voila!  Ravioli!  (Or other pasta product!)  However, there<br />is DEFINITELY ONE THING which this Chef Boyardi Beef Ravioli<br />14.25-ounce, Microwavable Bowl, (or most other similar 14 or<br />more microwavable bowl products) can do, that "semi-homemade"<br />ravioli cannot do.  And that is............ONCE THE BOWL IS<br />EMPTY, YOU CAN WASH, RINSE AND DRY IT THOROUGHLY, THEN<br />TURN THE CAP, OVER.  AND USE AS A SOAP DISH!  I personally<br />like the YELLOW cap of the this item, rather than the red<br />caps of similar items -- but it's your choice.  Those little<br />HOLES in the plastic cap, that allow microwaving, make<br />dandy drainers for soap!  And if -- like me -- you find the<br />soap doesn't drain or dry fast enough with just these little<br />holes, you can, (as I have done), cut into the four little<br />holes, (carefully!), to make one big hole!  You have enjoyed<br />the pasta, and now you are enjoying savings, by not having<br />to buy a soap dish!<br /><br />NOTE: I do NOT own a microwave, and so I eat this yummy<br />ravioli cold.  (Warming it up in a saucepan, you see, would<br />entail the extra washing-up of that saucepan -- something I<br />do NOT want to do.)  However, since I have never microwaved<br />this item, I don't know what, (if anything), microwaving<br />might do to the pretty yellow lid of this item.  IF micro-<br />waving damages or makes the lid unusuable for a soap-dish<br />drainer, my advice is to get ONE bowl, and either heat the<br />contents up in a saucepan, (with the attending washing-up),<br />or eat the contents oold, as I have.  (It's quite delicious<br />this way, as well.)<br /><br />For even more savings, buy just TWO Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli<br />14.25 ounce bowls, or similar product in similar size bowls.<br />Then, afterwards, you can have TWO soap-dishes -- and use each<br />one alternately, for even more drying of each now even MORE long-<br />lasting cake of soap!<br /><br />If you don't like to keep looking at the somewhat truly attract-<br />ive bowl covering, you can always remove it.  Use the bowl<br />plain, ((mine was white on the outside), or decorate it with<br />stick ons of your favourite people, places, or things!<br /><br />So, unless you are not only a lazy chef like me -- but a super-<br />duper lazy chef -- my recommendation would be to buy TWO, (and<br />ONLY two) of these Chef Boyardee Beef Ravioli, or simiar prod-<br />uct, in 14.25 ounce, (or close to that size), bowls, at your<br />local supermarket.  As far as I can see, buying a pack of 12<br />here on Amazon is, sadly, totally unnecessary -- unless, as I<br />have said, you are not only a lazy chef-- but a super-duper<br />lazy chef.<br /><br />However, not buying THIS particular product on Amazon should<br />NOT stop you from buying OTHER bargains on Amazon!  In fact,<br />you can, (as I have), take a blank sticker, write, "AMAZON<br />FOREVER!" on it, stick it carefully on one of the bowls of<br />your new soap dish, and enjoy it, along with other home-made<br />stickers of favourite sayings or pictures!<br /><br />Of course, if you REALLY like this product a lot, you CAN<br />always treat yourself to buying a dozen of them, from Amazon,<br />on special occasions, like your birthday or wedding, or other<br />anniversary, etc.!  Or, you might want to get together with<br />six friends, and each of you can make a set of soap-dishes<br />from the dozen offered here on Amazon.  Whatever way you<br />choose to enjoy this delightfully delicious product --<br />BON APPETITE!!!!
