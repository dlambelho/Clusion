I like to make my positive reviews as educational, encouraging, helpful and authentic as possible. My sugar-loving, ultra-nit-picky, processed-food-loving family members have all flown the coop so I'm FINALLY re-learning high-nutrition cooking (like Mother Earth News had inspired me towards 20+ years ago) and these Bob's Red Mill products are making my transition super-easy, tasty, creative and fun. This Natural Granola was the first `Bob's' item that I had tried out because I knew it would be more versatile for adding into other recipe's and I could simulate his other granola mixes because I always keep spices and dried fruit bits on hand (for adding to foods AND ESPECIALLY to reconstitute for natural sweeteners).<br />~ THE #1 THING THAT I"VE LIKE THE BEST ABOUT THIS GRANOLA is that it seems so filling to me that I've naturally and effortlessly reduced my portions, which is important for getting our stomach's back to a healthy / natural size without unpleasant brain associations or, in my case triggering my hypoglycemia).  THE #1 ADVANTAGE FOR EVERYONE ELSE WOULD BE HOW PHENOMINALLY VERSATILE THIS NATURAL GRANOLA IS FOR COUNTLESS DISHES & MEALS, SOOooo NEVER assume that healthier eating has to be tasteless, bland or boring !!<br />~ Breakfast Suggestions:  For my taste I didn't need to add much sweetener at all, it's great either with just cold milk, or when I cook it I add in a little ginger and/or cinnamon (VERY health-benefitting spices) plus either a bit of honey or a sparse touch of molasses (bolder flavor and much cheaper than honey), or I sweeten it with a touch of stevia leaves or reconstituted dried fruits (in winter).  BUT, I also add some granola to my pancake mix, muffins and sprinkle it into my cooked 10-grain cereals to add some interesting texture.<br />~ Snacks: After realizing how filling (AND nutritious) it was, I tried out several of the easy, home-made granola-mix recipe's that I found online and saved it in the smallest Rubbermaid containers; it always filled me up when I was debating between a snack, a sandwich or a `meal'.  It's so much-healthier-than-cookies and far more environmentally friendly than the over-priced 100-calorie snack-packs, I also learned to add it to yogurt cups to make it more filling and to feel fuller longer, and I've begun trying some very-healthy low-cal cookie recipe's which I've added this granola (only making them about the size of most cookies)<br />~ Cooking:  You can add this granola almost ANYWHERE you use fillers or bread crumbs, including (but not limited to): adding some to the coating for your veggies or meats before frying, definitely add some to your stuffing / dressings to add flavor to FINALLY retain a better-than-mush texture, experiment by adding some to soups, stews or even chili for more substance and for a passive thickener (no kidding!), it made my sloppy-joe's and meatloaf more awesome than ever, it can add healthy nutrients and texture to almost any casserole (replace those unhealthy French-fried onions!) and it definitely goes great in goulash;<br />~ Baking: FIRST, if there's any chance that anyone is allergic to nuts, use granola for a fabulous substitute.  I've been having so much fun, success and getting raves by adding this granola to muffins, breads, graham cracker crusts, carrot / coffee cakes, BREAD PUDDING, cookies, pies (again acts somewhat like a mild/passive thickener), into the filling of bundt cakes, it's phenomenal in carmel/sweet-rolls, IT'S FABULOUS in frostings like caramel-coconut over german chocolate, and I'd better stop before your drooling shorts out your keyboard :)<br />~ SOME FINAL TIPS:<br />#1): When whole-grain portions are adjusted DOWN to natural, nutritional-needs-sized portions (and you'll see this echoed across numerous product revives) these cereals ACTUALLY ARE LESS EXPENSIVE than the mega-processed, bloating cereals we've been media-blasted into becoming addicted to.<br />#2): We humans DO have the adequate brainpower to begin incorporating healthier ingredients into our families diets within your means; such as: we can purchase JUST ONE PACKAGE of most of the Bob's products at most local grocery stores for trying them out, experimenting and adjusting to them,  then save money by ordering, pantry-ing and saving money via the larger quantities here on Amazon.  I've now purchased several more of the `Bob's' products like the 10-grain cereals, Flaxseed, etc., WHICH I've also been adding into my recipe's; the point is that WE CAN find numerous ways to add a little more nutrition to our meals.<br />#3):  IT'S FUNNY how my family members (and their boyfriends/girlfriends) have been liking my healthier recipe's so much that they've begun to ask more about the recipe's and ingredients.  And after their initial shock that they actually liked things that were very nutritious, they're needed to address their negative prejudices about genuinely healthy ingredients and foods and have begun opening their minds (I WISH THAT I HAD INSISTED ON MAINTAINING MY VALUE OF NUTRITION BEING THE HIGHEST PRIORITY WHEN MY CHILDREN WERE SMALL).<br /> #4): I'm betting that Bob would agree that whether we choose his products or a similar product or the most nutritious that we can afford, we've all got to realize that there are countless reasons (the health care crisis being only one reason) why we absolutely must improve our eating habits AND try to be as environmentally considerate as we do so.<br />#5):  I have successfully tried several of the recipe's that are printed on the `Bob's' packages, but while I was at the library the other day I noticed a Bob's Red Mill Cookbook and `Baking Book'!  Although I was too short on time to investigate them, I knew that if I had found dozens of ways to successfully incorporate these healthier ingredients into my dishes and meals, imagine what they could offer with all their experience and resources, I ordered it here on Amazon and I'll recommend that everyone at least consider look into their cooking books if you're serious about learning to incorporate healthier ingredients into your dishes and meals.
