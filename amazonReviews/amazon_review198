I've commented on the Vino Italiano Motepulciano kit, and this review will have some of the similar info.  I really like the Italian reds, and the Valpolicella the best of them (I am currently racking my 4th batch of the Valpolicella).  If you make the kit by following the instructions, it will turn out dry.  I drink dry, but my preference is for a wine to be slightly dry, so I make modifications to the program.<br /><br />I have just started my 15th kit so my experience level is getting up there. I've done kits from a couple of other companies; Wine Expert, and Vino Vida. I've bought kits from other online companies, from a local brew hut, and from Amazon. I'll continue to buy these kits so long as they are selling them at this value.<br /><br />You cannot beat the Vino Italiano Kits. They are complete with everything, delivered to your door with free shipping, and they make a really good wine. Let me back up and say first that a wine I like may not be good to someone else. We each have our own preferences. I've had many a wine served up at restaurants with price ranges of [...] to [...] a bottle. And the wine I am making now I like better than pretty much anything I've tasted from the restaurant, or the store.<br /><br />I have tried the Valpolicella, Shiraz, Reisling and the Montepulciano from Vino Italiano. I have made a couple merlots, some white zinfandels also, but from other companies. I prefer the reds, and made the others because my kids requested.<br /><br />I'll typically, but not always, spike the kit with additional sugar to up the alcohol content slightly. If you follow the instructions, the initial specific gravity comes out around 1.080-1.084. By adding a couple pounds of sugar in the form of corn syrup or simple syrup, you get to around 1.09 or better. That usually will give a final ABV of 11.5 - 12%. Other things that I do outside of the kit instructions include adding 1 cup of black oak chips, 1-2 tbsp of vanilla extract, and a lb or two of some black cherries, blue berries or black berries (found in the frozen foods section at the store). Lastly, I like my wine not so dry, so I'll back sweeten just as I am bottling. Again using corn syrup and usually between 8 - 16 oz per 6 gallons. To me the corn syrup seems to be better than simple syrup, but that's just my preference.<br /><br />I love the stuff. Currently my production is having a hard time keeping up with my consumption. Cheers.<br /><br />Dec 31, 2010 Update!!!<br /><br />We opened several bottles of the Valpolicella over the holidays.  This is from wine that I made in March 2010.  With every batch, I retain 2 - 5 bottles and let age somewhat.  Usually I drink the rest, beginning immediately after bottling.  The wine is pretty good, even though it is pretty young.  Let me state for the record, this is my preference and everyone's taste is different.  Make/drink what you like, and don't let anyone tell you its wrong...  The Valpolicella that we drank over the holidays had aged about 9 months, and I must say, it was very good. The aging had made a good wine even better.  For the most part, I followed the instructions included in the kit with some additions.  In this batch, I had added 2 lbs of corn syrup and about 1 1/2 cups of black oak chips to the kit at the start of the fermentation process.  The alcohol content, after 2 weeks of fermentation, calculated to be around 14.7%.  A little high, and no doubt due to the added corn syrup.  I racked the wine, clarified and aged it another 4 weeks before bottling.  And when I bottled the wine, I back-sweetened with another 1 lb of corn syrup and added some potassium metabisulfite (1/4 tsp dissolved in 1/2 cup of water to preserve and prevent after-fermentation).  This wine has received the most compliments from family and friends.  I just ordered 2 more kits and will try to replicate the recipe (I keep a wine log of every batch so as to capture the important points of the good, and the bad!).  I hope this helps with your wine making and you enjoy the fruits of the vine as much as I do...  Cheers.  Sam<br /><br />May 2012 Update!!!<br /><br />I have made a couple of changes to the recipe that have been an improvement.  First, I included the recommendation from another review that said to make the kit to only 5 gallons instead of the 6 gallons that the recipe calls for.  Sure, you get 4 less bottles of wine.  But, this improves the fullness of the wine and its finish.  Secondly, I boil 2 - 4 ounces of dark oak chips in a quart of water for 5 minutes. This is then added to the juice and then diluted to the 5 gallon level.  Be sure to let the whole solution cool to 70 - 75 deg F before the yeast is added.  Add the oak chips and all the liquid!  This really improves the flavor, adding a powerful oak flavor that smooths the final wine and improves its overall taste.  I have incorporated both these steps into all the Vino Italiano wine kits.
