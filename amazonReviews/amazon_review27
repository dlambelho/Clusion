Make sure you're using good water.<br /><br />Water temperature...<br />This is where most mistakes are made. Brew your green tea too hot, and your tea will become bitter. The correct temperature does vary depending on the green tea, but for most it is around 165-170 degrees F (73-76 C.)<br /><br />Proportion of green tea to water...<br />Most of our green teas are brewed at 1 heaping teaspoon (5 grams) per 8 ounces of water, but this can vary depending on the tea.<br /><br />Brew time...<br />Generally, two minutes is all it takes Any longer, and the taste may becomes too bitter. Also, it's very important to NOT stir, shake, or mix the tea.<br /><br />Allowing the tea room to expand...<br />This is rather important. Chinese green tea is compact - it needs room to expand. Tea balls do not work well at all. You'll be much better off using a Japanese teapot that was designed with green tea in mind. It is a one time investment of between $30-$100, and will make your life so much easier.<br /><br />Take a good look at the inside of this green tea teapot to the left, made in Japan. The infuser screen goes all the way around the inside of the teapot, allowing the tea leaves to expand fully. This is the best kind to use. These teapots are rather small, about the size of a grapefruit, and usually hold 8-13 ounces or so.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002K2MUUY">Lipton Green Tea - 100% Natural, 2009 New Spring Green Tea, 50 Fresh Tea Bags from China by A2AWorld Green Tea</a>
