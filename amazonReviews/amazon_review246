I was almost put off using coconut oil entirely, after purchasing another brand (I think NOW was it, but different packaging). It came hard as a rock, yellow-looking and smelled pretty foul (almost sickly-sweet) - certainly nothing like coconut. I literally was chipping it out of the jar, and melting it was near impossible. Eventually, I realized that I was dealing with rancid oil, so it's pretty fortunate that I didn't use it all that often. Yuck.<br /><br />After watching a view Youtube videos for hair care, I noticed everyone's was white, creamy and you could easily scoop it out of the jar, so I decided to give it another shot and purchased Nutiva in February 2011. I'm so glad I did, too, because this stuff is great and for a number of things, some of which caught me off guard.<br /><br />- Cooking -<br />I enjoy cooking with it now and then, especially with my quick-fix quesadillas when I don't have time to cook anything else. However, it doesn't work on everything due to the subtle yet nutty flavor it can give, but I do like it for frying. Your place will smell like coconut when you fry with it, as a warning. I do love how fast it heats up, though.<br /><br />- Hair -<br />I originally intended to use this for hair and as a deep conditioning mask. I am biracial, with 3A/3b and a tinge of 3C hair. While I usually prefer to have it relaxed, I decided to give it a break due to lack of funds. The hard water we have here has been wreaking havoc on my hair and it's been in need of a trim for a while, but this stuff has greatly improved things, and it even can be used (lightly) to help tame frizz to some degree as a leave-in. My ringlets are back and the best-looking they've been since I can remember, and all I've been using since then is just Aphogee Green Tea spray, coconut oil and occasional argan oil.<br /><br />- Skin -<br />I consistently use this on my body and at night as skin cream. For the face, you only need a tiny, tiny amount. It also helps to tame down blemishes, which is a bonus, and leaves skin glowy. Last year or the year before, I also developed what looked like flesh-colored moles, which I thought were blemishes at first, but I can't be certain. Nothing I did would get rid of them though, until I started using the oil, which I found odd, but at least it worked! All in all, my skin has dramatically improved using this, with the help of some other products, and I don't feel I have to wear foundation.<br /><br />- Pets -<br />I give 1/2 tbls. to my cats and 1 tbls. to my dog a few times a week to help maintain their coats and keep their skin nice. It seems to be doing great and they've stopped driving me mental with scratching. I also tried it in hopes of helping my dog with her seizures. While it's not a drastic improvement, they have been fewer in between, which may or may not have a connection. I just mix it in their food maybe 2-3 days a week (ask your vet about how often, especially if they have health problems), and they love it. Even my female cat, who's picky about what she'll eat licks at the oil before she munches away.<br /><br />- Warts -<br />Short of the suspicious-looking things on my face at one point, I don't get moles, warts, or even freckles. However, I did get one whopping wart on the top of my big toe last year, which nothing would get rid of. I tried apple cider vinegar, wart patches and gels - you name it; I tried it. Not only did it hurt like crazy and work slowly, but it never got rid of it. All I did get was a scar and a lot of grief, only for it to return a few weeks later.<br /><br />When I started using coconut oil on the skin, I realized one day, like with my face, that my wart that had grown back was getting smaller. I kept watching it and finally realized the connection. I started using bandaids and applied a glob of oil on the spot before bed and then really started noticing results. This wart was the size of a chick pea (sorry to be gross lol), but now you can't see anything.<br /><br />I finally looked things up and realized that it was the acid in the oil that attacks lipid-coated virus cells, such as what's associated with HPV (warts), so I guess it makes sense. I was surprised though! I can tell due to the texture of the skin that it's not 100% gone (roots), but it still getting better and I'm not embarrassed anymore. It took about a month, but the more painful options took just as long and this is pain-free. So, it's something to try!<br /><br />Love this stuff and can't stop raving about it. I'm going to purchase more soon in this size to keep one in my kitchen and one in my bathroom again, plus a larger one for the mutts. The bathroom one still has plenty in it, despite me using it near-daily.
