Truly homemade brownies are great, of course, but there are times (more than I care to admit) when I suddenly have a craving for some chocolate, & the brownie form thereof is preferred, but I simply don't care to take the time & engage in the effort associated with 'from scratch' (besides, I don't always have the chocolate [let alone various other] ingredients for such on hand [& to an extent, that's intentional]).<br /><br />So, what 'feeding a brownie craving' usually comes down to, for me, is to grab a box of this terrific brownie mix (& no other, at this point [it's simply that good]), throw in the specified egg, vegetable oil, & water, & then after stirring, I pour it into what I now think of as a 'magic', insulated, small, (& non-stick) square metal pan (& for what it's worth, I do notice a definite 'optimized' outcome when baking this in an insulated pan), & then partake of the delicious goodness approximately 40 minutes later (I bake it for 33 minutes [extra time due to the type of pan], turn off the oven & let them stay in for another 2 minutes, & then after approximately 5 minutes outside of the oven, I take a silicone spatula to it, & 'begin extracting' ;) [an interesting 'benefit' to marking the pieces with a somewhat firm & relatively slim silicone spatula, is that it 'wraps' the top 'edges' slightly, so there are no crumb-like anythings which get separated from the piece, & to boot, the top edges of the pieces end up looking more 'neat' (though don't get me wrong, I also love the more 'crisp-ish'-along-the-top -type 'edge' often found with homemade brownies, & that often have a kind of looks-like-the-top-of-a-pie-crust -type top layer)]).<br /><br />For my first taste, I don't wait for these to completely cool (nowhere near), & despite my removing the first piece only ~5 minutes post-oven, the piece stays together (enough for 'transport', & with 'help'/support from the silicone spatula) (& vs. being a kind of semi-solid that breaks up like crazy wherever pressure occurred during 'lift-off'), & the cohesion isn't stiff, & it's not lava-like -- it's got that recognizable moist aspect that gives it a ~cake-like appeal (though it ends up having a 'thicker' texture than a cake would [these are brownies, afterall]).<br /><br />Honestly, I marvel at both the taste & texture of the brownies made from this mix -- they're terrific, & I'd prefer these brownies to most others, without a doubt (& yes, I'm also including 'from scratch' homemade, when I say that) -- the outcome produced in conjunction with this mix is close to the perfect balance for me of the major 'factors' associated with the 'brownie experience' -- namely, a wonderful & chocolatey-fudge taste, a moist & 'just right' chewy texture, & importantly, the repeatability of my being able to 'reproduce' the result over & over, each time I utilize the mix.<br /><br />That being said, I cannot overstate the importance of that insulated metal pan to the delectably optimized outcome I've experienced with this mix -- I've baked this with a glass pan, & with a standard metal pan, as well, & although the brownies tasted very good, the result from those wasn't as 'even' as that found with an insulated metal pan, & they were definitely not as moist (though their extra chewiness was also welcome, & if I let the insulated pan -made brownies cool long enough, they also have a chewiness that differs from the hot-off-the-presses outcome I am at times partial to, & seem to simply 'go for' when in the throes of a brownie craving [part of the reason for which is that this more cake-like brownie experience (in cutting a few pieces while still quite warm [though not steaming hot] ends up making for a great base beneath the all natural canned-in-a-jar cherry pie mix topping that has become a yummy addition for any while-still-quite-warm brownie slices I decide to enjoy 'first' [& when I have any of the brownie slices in their otherwise preferred 'au natural' form, they taste terrific whether still warm, or whether cooled & at room temp, & whether same day or next]).<br /><br />The manufacturer of this product has kept the 'customer contribution to the mix composition' aspect to a minimum, but not at the expense of the mix subsequently having a bunch of artificial whatnot in the place of would-be-used-with-a-scratch-recipe ingredients (although, to be clear, the cocoa powder used in the mix does get 'fancied up' a tad, what with the manufacturer also including some powdered sugar in the mix [& I mention this only to point out that although it isn't 'artificial', it isn't always included by folks in a to-make-from-scratch brownie recipe (regardless, if it's part of the ingredient 'choir' of this mix, & knowing what I do about the outcome, I appreciate its 'voice')]).<br /><br />The picture associated with this listing of the product doesn't happen to show what is printed on the very top (you can see a hint of such, though it's hard to read in the existing image), but what it says is, "Premium Brownie Mix" & then beneath that, "No Preservatives".<br /><br />The brownies I make from this mix -- & which I bake (& exclusively, at this point) in an insulated metal pan (I truly cannot overstate the importance of this aspect, or the amazing difference that this pan makes) do not end up in any way reminding me of what I have come to think of as a 'made from a box' taste (or 'look') otherwise typically encountered with off-a-shelf boxed mixes.  The magic produced by pairing this mix, & the minimal additional ingredients called for, with an insulated metal pan, results in something that many might think was homemade, but regardless, many would find to be delicious.<br /><br />With all due respect to -- and in addition to how much I love -- the wonderful homemade brownies made by my grandmother, & by my mother, I hereby profess food-love for the brownies I can make with this mix...
