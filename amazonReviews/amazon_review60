Because others' reviews have helped me so much in ordering and utilizing this product, I owe it to them and to people interested to share my own experience with Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar. It has helped me totally unexpectedly in many areas:<br /><br />1. After seeing countless positive reviews, I bought the product. However, I was so eager to try that I went to my supermarket and bought a raw, unfiltered, organic ACV to try it before my order would arrive. I had been feeling inexplicably weak, tired, achy, with bad a headache that was lasting: It felt like a flu, and I was really discouraged. Since I am on the Dukan diet, I thought maybe it was because I came to an exhaustion point, eating close to nothing and not losing anymore weight for a while. Alternating periods of starving and binging because even if you can eat how much you want on this diet, there is so much of the same food you feel like eating, and then you get so frustrated that you start accepting invitations and just jump on all the previously forbidden sweets, fatty stuff etc. Well, at least it has been my experience. To come back to our ACV, I got my bottle of another brand, got a shot (2 tbs in a glass of water) and MIRACULOUSLY, after maybe 15 to 30 seconds, I received like a kick, an amazing energy boost. My headache was gone, along with my overall fatigue, back pain and muscle ache (legs, arms, shoulders). It was close to bed time, so I went to sleep, and there I had an agitated night. I could feel that my body temperature (which is usually pretty low) had significantly raised. I woke up starving the next morning, and totally rested, with the ideal energy to start my day on the right foot. That was for the immediate effect, after taking only one serving.<br /><br />2. Day two, I decided to incorporate this into my diet, and since I am in a weight loss program, (lost 20lbs on the Dukan Diet between September 2011 and February 2012, but then because I wasn't able to keep it up seriously, I had alternated gain and loss of about 6.lbs from February to June) 2 weeks ago, I had decided to attack this diet seriously again, lost 6lbs the 3 days, and then (although eating less and less, and not feeling hungry at all) nothing at all for close to 2 weeks, even gaining some. Today is my 3rd day of incorporating this ACV ( 3 times a day in a large glass of water and sugar free peach syrup for the taste) and I have lost 6lbs, with more energy than ever, and eating way more than I used to. I feel hungry when I wake up and basically 2 hours after each meal, which is fine, because then I eat low calorie stuff, and it works.<br /><br />3. I have used it for several other stuff, all excited by this miraculous product:<br /><br />- Toner: I don't have skin problems or barely (other than it being extremely sensitive), and usually only clean my face with rose water on a cotton swab, morning and night. With Almond oil when I put make up on, which is not everyday. I used it pure first, and it was too strong for my skin. So I used it diluted,and it's about the same as using rose water for me, except for the smell: Rose water smells better.<br /><br />- On allergies. I suffer from eczema, and another form of it which is dishydrosis (an unbalance of water in the skin that makes bubbles, like when you just burned yourself, on hands and feet. It is itching, and quite tiring because your body never feels comfortable. It usually happens to me in the summer when it starts to get hot) I applied pure ACV. It considerably relieved the itching, and many bubbles had disappeared the next day. I'm very happy with this, because I hadn't found much helpful stuff other than cortisone lotions that I try to avoid as much as I can.<br /><br />- On hair: I have a short, colored and highlighted hair style. My hair is very thick. I used ACV in place of after shampoo, diluted ( 2 tbs in a 1liter bottle of water) Hair is softer, highlights shiner, BUT as I said, my hair is thick and I hardly ever manage to dry it completely. As long as your hair is wet, even a little, the smell of vinegar doesn't go away. at night, I found my hair a bit dryer than usual, and today it looks like I just washed it. I will keep using it for a while and see, but I'm not sure I like this dry feeling. Will keep you updated on that.<br /><br />- Mask with the Aztek Healing Green Clay: very powerful stuff that leaves your skin scarily RED after use for about 30-45 minutes. It's great, but I have been using French green clay with rosewater for years, so except for the spectacular reaction with the vinegar, I am not sure it's better. I guess I'll keep you updated on that too. I am 100% sure though that it's better than any expensive mask out there. I strongly advise for putting a strong sunscreen afterwards and make sure your skin is well hydrated before going out, even if it's not so sunny. It seems to really remove dead skin and therefore leaves your skin more vulnerable to UV attacks.<br /><br />One more comment I'd like to make is that although the first day I drunk it it removed my cigarette stains and dental plaque better than the Extra Whitening Crest, I would recommend as others have to drink with a straw and rinse your mouth after drinking because it does soften the enamel.<br /><br />In short, I feel healthier than ever, went for an hour walk today, my metabolism seems to be significantly boosted, I am losing weight and seems to have burned a plateau (in combination with my weight loss plan), my skin looks great, my eczema is very significantly reduced, and all this on the 3rd day of using it. I say not many products can claim to be that efficient, when being cheap and healthy!<br /><br />4. Today I received my Bragg - Apple Cider Vinegar. I was so eager to try it, and opened it right away. Drunk my portion, and OMG it tastes so good! No syrup needed anymore for me. It's 10 times better than the other brand I had. I drink it with even more pleasure.
