My boyfriend and I received the Keurig Elite brewer as a Christmas gift after lusting after the brewers all of my friends and family owned.  We have been using a trusty Cuisinart 10-cup drip brewer for a couple of years now, and while it has served us well, it was a challenge to get a consistent cup of coffee.  Somehow we always ended up on either the too-strong or two-weak side of the line, despite our best efforts to be consistent.<br /><br />I should mention that we are students living on a very strict budget and we knew that the Keurig would end up being a little bit more costly than our Cuisinart.  But we really liked the idea of brewing coffee a cup at a time and cutting down on waste.  Thankfully, my generous sister surprised us with one for Christmas and it has really turned out to be a perfect gift!<br /><br />WARNING!<br /><br />I feel it is important to mention that we almost sent this back.  Considering how I've been singing its praises, I'm sure this is surprising, but there is something that ALL new Keurig owners should be made aware of.  The first maybe six or so cups aren't going to taste quite right.  Apparently this is a common problem.  There is a sort of plastic-y taste going on, even with coffees that don't normally have that fake finish.  It's the newness of the brewer.  Run five cups of straight water through it and then one cup of white vinegar to get rid of this problem.  I can't imagine how many people must have received one of these and then written it off immediately because of this issue.  It's a quick fix and a one-time deal, so be aware of that ahead of time.<br /><br />Now... as I was saying:<br /><br />The Keurig Elite is the entry level of the full size brewers (Keurig also makes a Mini, but we have friends who have had problems with that model).  It has a great water carafe that only needs to be refilled once every six cups (convenient!).  There is no digital display unlike some of the higher end models, but we don't find that a problem.  For those wanting to set up brew times in advance, though, that might be a make-or-break feature.  We manage just fine without it in our household.  It has the two cup sizes and, although they are only two ounces apart in size, the difference between the two can be quite dramatic.  I like a milder cup of coffee while my boyfriend prefers something stronger so I brew on the larger size while he picks the more potent smaller for his cup.<br /><br />When we turn the power on in the morning it takes about 3 minutes for the brewer to heat up and then it really truly does brew the cup in less than a minute.  SO convenient when you want to make a quick cup on your way out the door!  No muss, no fuss.<br /><br />We tried out several pods from the 12 k-cup sample pack the brewer came with (another bonus!) and since then we've also tried out a few of Keurig's other offerings.  It's really hit-and-miss in terms of what you'll like and what will be positively NOT your cup of coffee.  Here are some of the blends we have tried and enjoyed:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00474OR8G">Caribou Coffee, Caribou Blend, K-Cup Portion Pack for Keurig K-Cup Brewers, 24-Count</a> - Our standard go-to good cup of coffee.  Nothing fancy or amazing, but consistently good flavor.  You can't go wrong with this medium roast.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003JA5KLM">Green Mountain Coffee Nantucket Blend, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a> - An alternative to the Caribou Blend that might be easier to find in most stores.  One of the few Green Mountain cups that I've tried and enjoyed.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005IPJTZE">Swiss miss Hot Cocoa K-Cup, Milk Chocolate, 12-Count</a> - The only hot chocolate k-cup we've tried and enjoyed so far.  It is artificially sweetened and you can tell that immediately, but it isn't weak or watery and definitely gets the job done.  Tip: shake the pod before you put it in the machine to loosen the powder.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about the Keurig and its pod system, however, is that the pods are wasteful and non-recyclable.  Very disappointing.  Keurig is reportedly working on making a recyclable pod, but until that comes out I feel a bit guilty about going through the pods so quickly.  However, there is a solution to this problem!  We picked up the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0051SU0OW">ekobrew Cup, Refillable Cup For Keurig K-Cup Brewers, Brown, 1-Count</a> to use with our brewer!  And it has been perfect!  I'm Canadian so every time I visit home I pick up a big drum of Tim Horton's coffee (the best cheap coffee money can buy) and I can still use it in this little reuseable k cup.  Some reviewers had said that the ekobrew doesn't work with all Keurig models but I can attest to the fact that it works perfectly with the Elite brewer.  Apparently it is leaps and bounds better than Keurig's own reuseable My K Cup pod.  It's definitely worth the $10!<br /><br />Honestly, you really can't go wrong with the Keurig Elite.  We love it as a one-cup brewer without all the bells and whistles and we can't wait to try out the new pods we're set to receive from the included buy 2 get 2 free promotion through Keurig's website.
