Hey there retrodog (reviewer) - I use to eat this as a kid too. With mayo or Miracle Whip on white bread or toast. Lots of other great ways to use it too - in deviled eggs, or mixed with horseradish and stuffed into cherry tomatoes (add sliced olives to the top and it's even better). Mix with veggies to make a zingy tasting wrap. I've even known people to put it on their baked potatoes with sour cream. You can spice up mac & cheese with it too.<br /><br />In short: It's relatively cheap (3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), easy to open (pull top lid), and light weight (for back packs, lunch bags, and emergency "go" bags.<br /><br />In depth review:<br /><br />It may not be the healthiest item on the store shelves (relatively high in cholesterol and salt), but it is an excellent quick sandwich if you're in a hurry, very cheap (when you get it at a good price) for those who are on tight budgets (you can get 2-3 sandwiches per 3 oz can), it's also a great emergency food to keep in your home, and is also great for emergency "go" or "bug out" bags. These days, with threats of terrorism and so many natural disasters, an easy to pack, small, light weight source of calories is essential.<br /><br />It's more than 98% meat and fat from chicken and beef, which are 2 things (meat and fat) you want to eat if you're in an emergency situation (no other food available) and need protein and calories to keep you going. This way you're body does not eat its own muscle and fat, so you stay strong and warm until help arrives or you get yourself out of what ever situation you're in. Imagine Eskimos; they ate lots of meat and fat to keep warm in harsh conditions. I'm not saying you want to live on this stuff for months on end, but for a few days or a few weeks, it can save your life - it's cheap, easy to open, light weight emergency calories.<br /><br />Amour's Vienna sausage and sausage bits are also good for the same reason. Keep these, crackers (whole wheat is best), and canned fruit on hand ALWAYS, no matter where you live. Canned beans (any kind) and rice (if you can get moist prepared rice packets) are also good emergency foods. You never know when you might need to stay in for days or weeks at a time with no electricity and no outside contact, or you may need to bug out and live on your own, w/o shopping or going to restaurants for days or weeks.<br /><br />And yes, Amour potted mean is also a great treat for your cat. Although I can't tell if Pauline E. Nordin (reviewer) was attempting sarcasm when referring to cat food, or if she's really had to eat cat food or food that tasted like cat food due to financial distress, but our cats loved it. We use to give it to them once in a while treat when we were kids (50s and 60s). Again, a little too high in cholesterol and salt though (I wish they made a low salt version) so keep it as a once in a while treat only. That goes for you and your cats.<br /><br />What's a good price? You can usually find it on sale; three 3 oz cans for $1.00. At $19.08 for 48 cans that's just under 40 cents per can. Not a bad deal at all if you can't find the 3 for $1 deal near you. And if you belong to Amazon Prime (see PracticalWaysToSaveMoney to find out how to get Amazon Prime for free, we have a special link for Amazon.com related posts) you don't pay for shipping, which saves you money on gas instead of going out to a special store to find that 3 for $1 price. If you live in a very rural area and can't find the 3 for $1 price, or if getting out to shop is difficult for you, we recommend getting this deal at Amazon for sure.<br /><br />Don't need 48 cans? Ask your neighbors to buy in bulk with you. This is always a great way to save. Everyone saves, everyone has emergency food on hand. Win-win.<br /><br />How many cans should you keep on hand for emergencies? We recommend 2 cans for every 3 to 4 people in your household for each week of emergency food you want to keep on hand. For example, if you are a family of 3 and want to keep a 3 week supply of emergency food in the house (three weeks is now recommended by experts), stock 6 cans. That means one can will feed 3 people twice a week for 3 weeks. If there are 4 people in your family, bump it up to 12 cans and you can afford to eat a bit more or feed neighbors if need be (or your cats). You fill in the other meals with other canned emergency food of course.<br /><br />How long to keep? Some cans will show a "best by" date on the bottom. Some cans will show a date of manufacture. It depends on what facility is was packaged in. If it has a date of manufacture, according to Amour you're guaranteed good taste for a minimum of 2 years. But knowing this product, we'd say 3 years or more. Most cans with a "best by" date will have at least 2 to 3 years before you've come to that date (for example the can I bought this week expires in July 2014), but that doest not mean you can't eat it after that. According to Amour, as long as the can is sealed it's good "indefinitely", which is why it's a great emergency preparedness product. WTSHTF I'd eat a 15 year old can of potted mean over bugs any day if I were starving (thinking of those survival shows). But hopefully it will never come to that. And like all emergency preparedness foods, you should rotate on a first in first out basis. Eat the old stock before it gets to it's "best by" date and replenish with new stock. That goes for any food.
