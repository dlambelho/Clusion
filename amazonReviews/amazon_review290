The pepper (Capsicum Annuum L.) is a vegetable that has its origin in tropical and subtropical regions of America, mainly in Bolivia-Peru area, where seeds have been found in ancestral forms for more than 7,000 years and spread to the Americas and then the rest of the world. Chili stands out for its high content of ascorbic acid value, which is even higher than that of citrus. Chili peppers have a value almost 10 times higher vitamin A than regular peppers. In the placenta and septa of chili peppers are glands or receptacles rich in alkaloids (capsacinoides), among which prevails capsaicin, which determine the degree of pungency of the fruit.<br /><br />A remarkable property is that it works against pain. Capsaicin is the molecule that red pepper hot and today it is an indispensable tool in pharmacological research of pain, painful as it is, its effect remains an analgesic response. From this discovery the pharmaceutical industry continues trying and trying to modify the molecule so that not only produces irritation but analgesia. The intention is to produce a similar molecule, more useful and less irritating than the original product from chili. In addition to reducing the transmission of pain, capsaicin also increases the production of the enzyme collagenase and prostaglandins, reducing both pain and inflammation in men.<br /><br />The pepper also produces discharge of endorphins, as a defense against painful episodes. These substances as well as various effects of analgesics and pain tolerance, cause euphoric effects. Hence, the hypothesis is that endorphins are the ones that carry the pleasure of eating chili and are the starting point of research seeking ways to prevent pain.<br /><br />The Merkaba is therefore used as a welcome ingredient in a wide range of menus, enhancing the flavor of food.
