Green Tea, Orange, Passionfruit and Jasmine.  An excellent combination.  Reminds me of this one time..<br /><br />Twas the Summer of 1933, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford had requisitioned the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish for Privateering in the Lesser Antilles under a Letter of Marque and Reprisal ordered by King George V.  We had pushed through the Windward Islands, with a quick stop in Barbados to resupply.<br /><br />Again, our journey was filled with devious treachery.  Once the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish sailed from the protection of the Leeward Islands, controlled of course by His Majesty's Royal Navy (the finest Navy on all the high seas!), the waters of the Lesser Antilles were patrolled by a cacophony of Spanish Armada's and Dutch Privateers.  Just two weeks prior we had commandeered the Dutch ship Eendracht, and it's Captain, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, under legally sanctioned duress (we Englishman always operate within the law), told of a Dutch fort with an "embarrassment of riches" on the Dutch island of La Tortuga.  Long known for it's rich salt deposits, First Mate Tignor, a fine military tactician, drew up a brilliant assault plan upon the La Tortuga.<br /><br />We approached through the dense tropical jungle, with First Mate Tignor on point.  We made sure our muskets were loaded, for the assault had a high probability of bloodshed.  But prepared we all were.  "I never liked em Dutchies, a bunch of nancies them be", bellowed Midshipman Householder.  "Let me at em, Skipper, and I swear I'll make the King Proud."  We tipped further until they reached the base of the outer wall of the Dutch fort.  We threw our grappling hooks over the outer wall, and prepared for our siege.<br /><br />As soon as they descended the wall, they heard the distinct screams, of.... a damsel!<br /><br />"With your authority skipper, I call onesies on the damsel", First Mate Tignor asked.<br /><br />"You have my authority First Mate Tignor, you will rescue her and meet us back here in thirty-six minutes", I responded.<br /><br />"For England", called First Mate Tignor.<br /><br />"For the King", I answered.<br /><br />And with that, First Mate Tignor took off.<br /><br />As he followed the sullen screams of the fair maiden's call, First Mate Tignor found his pathway blocked by six unsavory Dutch buccaneers.<br /><br />"A filthy Englishman", gruffed the tall one, "we ought to slit his throat right here".<br /><br />Their leader, a unshaven, slightly portly fellow spoke next.  "My name is Lord Petr Laars Oxidant, of Rotterdam.  I'm the ranking officer of this outpost, and you have just unfairly angered me.  I'll gladly draw swords with an Englishman as filthy as you".  And with that, Captain Petr Laars Oxidant unsheathed his cutlass.<br /><br />First Mate Tignor was faster on the draw, as his cutlass, forged by pure Japanese steel, a gift from the Samurai King of Eto, flew out from his side and plunged deep within the chest of the gruff, tall Dutchman.  With the speed and precision of a bolt of lightning, First Mate Tignor dispatched three more of the Dutch.  One of the remaining Dutchman fled terrified, as all are well aware of the fear and cowardice of the Dutch.  All that stood between First Mate Tignor and the fair maiden was Lord Petr Laars Oxidant.<br /><br />"It is a good day to die", exclaimed First Mate Tignor, as he volleyed a thrust of Lord Oxidant's cutlass.  Swish.  Miss.  Clink.  Blocked.  Whirrrrr.  Lord Oxidant's cutlass just barely missed First Mate Tignor's ear.<br /><br />"You have skill, Englishman", Lord Oxidant growled, "but you still have much to learn.  You see, the Dutch are a proud nation, built upon the pillars of faith, country, honor, freedom and..."<br /><br />Before Lord Oxidant could finish his speech, First Mate Tignor thrust the cutlass deep through Lord Oxidant's callous heart.  At the very moment, a lost and confused Boson's Mate Micklegal stumbled upon the swashbuckling duo a half seconds time before the fatal blow.  Boson's Mate Micklegal knelt down next to Lord Oxidant's lifeless body and retrieved a pouch of green tea leaves from his coat.  "From henceforth", Boson's Mate Micklegal decreed, "let this tea be known as "Anti-Oxidant Green Tea".  Oh that clever Boson's Mate Micklegal.<br /><br />Boson's Mate Micklegal followed First Mate Tignor to the rear wall, and helped as First Mate Tignor cut the restraints above the fair maiden's hands.<br /><br />"My hero", the fair maiden cried, "I owe you my life kind sir, for I am Lady Jasmine, of Port Royal, daughter of Lord Sydney Olivier, Governor of Jamaica."<br /><br />"Well my lady", First Mate Tignor said as he tipped his hat and kneeled, "First Mate Tignor, of Portsmouth, England, at your service".  First Mate Tignor thrust his arms around Lady Jasmine and tossed her over his shoulder as she giggled. "Welcome to the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, my lady", he chuckled, a wink in his eye.<br /><br />The crew rejoiced upon the deck of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish.  The treasure at the Dutch Fort, or, that that remained of the treasure were a barrel of oranges, a few spices, and an odd fruit unfamiliar to us.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, his trusty kettle in hand, decided tea would be most proper.  He placed the Anti Oxidant green tea leaves into the kettle, and added the zest of the orange.  But Boson's Mate Micklegal believed the tea was missing something.  He placed the spice and the essence of the strange fruit into the kettle as well.<br /><br />"What do you call this type of tea Boson's Mate Micklegal?", I asked, "It surely cannot be Earl Grey".  (As all fine Englishman know, that Earl Grey Tea, "The Earl", is the finest tea in His Majesty's empire, truly the tea of Kings.)<br /><br />Boson's Mate Micklegal glanced over at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  "Well Captain, the fruit is called 'The Fruit of Passion', in honor of that", pointing at First Mate Tignor and Lady Jasmine.  "And the spice, well, that's Jasmine Spice Captain."  I gave Boson's Mate Micklegal a courteous smile.<br /><br />That night, in a sleepwalk, Boson's Mate Micklegal found a bottle of fine Glen Fiddych, stowed away in the hold, consumed it, and then set the oranges, fruit of passion, and Jasmine spice ablaze on the aft deck so that he could toast his baguette.  Oh well, such is life in the Lesser Antilles.<br /><br />I had forgotten of this deep and fruit infused tea for many years, until a fellow of mine brewed me a fine cup of Green Tea with Orange, Passionfruit and Jasmine made by the hacks at Lipton, that was spot on.  A lovely memory!
