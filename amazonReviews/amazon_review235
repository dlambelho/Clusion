"Jamacian Mountain Peak" Instant coffee has won a "Monde Selection" award, (Luxembourg, 1990), and has an impressive<br />reputation.  I have seen "Jamacian Blue Mountain" ccffee featured in a "By Appointment To The King of _____", famous mail-order coffee company.  This would be the GROUND coffee version, (they don't, sadly, offer any instant coffee in this famous mail-order house....although I have, several times, asked them to do so), but the fact is that their "Jamacian Blue Mountain" coffee is not only a "by appointment to Royalty" coffee....but it is also on their "specialty" list, and can only be ordered at certain times of the year!  "Jamacian Blue Mountain" coffee is also listed in the book, "100 Things To Buy Before You Die", (by Maggie Davis).  It is NOT the first choice in coffees, (that belongs to 'kopi lewca' coffee....which is produced with the help of certain insects), but IS choice Number 2.<br /><br />So, when I saw what looks to be, (both from name and description), an INSTANT COFFEE version of Jamacian Blue Mountain coffee, instant-coffee-drinking me could NOT resist it!<br /><br />Looking at the coffee before opening it, I noticed that this is a TRUE instant coffee....quite powdery, with no hint of the larger granules one finds in freeze-dried instant coffee.  In the jar, it is a surprisingly light brown -- almost a hazelnut coolour, much lighter than most other instant coffees.  If you look closely, SOME of the granules seem to sparkle, just a bit, as the light hits them.  I remember hearing about "flavour crystals" in another brand of instant coffee, (forget which one at the moment), but also remember calling up the oompany, and discovering that "flavour crystals" were created by the way the coffee granules are cut....<br /><br />The suggested tags for this coffee include "organic coffee" -- and though I believe that a coffee with this much reputation MUST be organically grown, the words "Organic" or "CertIfied Organic", appear no-where on the bottle's label.  Strange.....<br /><br />Anyway, though I usually blend all my instant coffees together, (dry), in a cannister, to get my own unique blend, (and also to disguise the taste of instant coffees I have bought and do not like, (such as Cafe Bustelo, Instant Decaffeinated Espresso coffee, which I found too strong and bitter), I decided to honour JAMACIAN MOUNTAIN PEAK instant coffee, and its reputation, by using it, and it alone, io make at least the first few cups of this coffee....<br /><br />I found the taste to be very, very mild.  (It is no accident, that JACOB'S CRONAT GOLD instant cofee is sold by Amazon, as an option, with Jamacian Mountain Peak Instant Coffee...as it too, has a very mild flavour.)  If you like MILD coffee, Jamacian Montain Peak Coffee should definitely be your choice.  Jacob's Cronat Gold, (for which I have also written a review for Amazon), is excellent, mild coffee as well -- but this Jamacian Mountain Gold coffee, when imbibed, has surprising, fleeting moments of a darker, richer flavour on the tongue, amongst most of the moments, which impart a pleasing mildness....<br /><br />As someone who prefers a somewhat darker and richer blend, (my favourite -- though lazy me doesn't make it too often -- is regular, ground French Roast coffee), I found I had to add TWO rounded teaspoons of Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee to my 16 ounce coffee cup, to get even an approximation of coffee flavour...at least, coffee flavour as I like to drink it.  Doing this, the Jamacian Mountain Peak coffee did have a very pleasant taste -- but a very mild one.  It reminded me, somewhat, of a sweet and innoent girl making her society debut.  Nothing loud, strong or raucaus, just a pleasant, mild sweetness -- not unpleasant at all, but not that mature, either.....<br /><br />I intend to have a cup or two of Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee mixed with my favourite instant coffee -- Taster's Choice Original.  To my American taste, I suspect that the two will be perfect together.  Or, perhaps, mixed with an instant coffee I have also liked, but found a little too strong and bitter for my tastes -- Taster's Choice Gourmet Maragor Bold.  Tge rich, dark flavour of the Taster's Choice Instant Maragor Bold, and the delicate, warm flavour of the Jamacian Mountain Peak instant coffee should go very well together, I think!  A "marriage" of two great instant coffees! I think they'll have their "honeymoon" in Jamacia!  (When I buy the Taster's Choice Maragor Bold Instant coffee, and mix it with the item here being reviewed, I'll report on whether this will be a "long and happy marriage", or not.  But from what I know of drinking both instant coffees individually, I have no doubt it will be!  Stay tuned for the update! )
