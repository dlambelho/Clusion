I decided to start making my own hemp milk.  My boys are allergic to wheat/gluten, dairy/beef, eggs/chicken, shellfish, peanuts, soy, corn, sesame, mushrooms, maple, oranges and cinnamon so they are very restricted vegans eating a high raw and organic diet.  Hemp is wonderful for protein, omegas, and healthy fats!<br /><br />At first I had subscribed and saved to this 8 oz (pack of 3) organic hempseed for $16.75.  I bought 10 (30 packs) to start. That's about 70 cents per ounce. I like the portable packs for traveling, visiting grandparents, snacking out of.  An ounce is 3 TBSP which is one serving.<br /><br />I bought quarts of commercial hemp milk for years, Manitoba Harvest, Living Harvest and Pacific (Pacific Vanilla was our favorite.)  I did the Amazon s/s program.  But when I bought my Blendtec Wildside blender I started thinking "I CAN MAKE IT MYSELF!"<br /><br />Here's what you need:<br />a high performance blender like VitaMix or Blendtec is best<br />Shelled hempseed, 8 ounces<br />purified water<br />a nut milk bag for straining (sold on Amazon for $8)<br />a sweetener like honey, agave, dates, or brown rice syrup<br />vanilla if you like<br />Real salt or sea salt of high quality<br />two 78 ounce frigoverre glass jars with tight sealing hermetic lids (sold on Amazon for $10-15) or equivalent<br /><br />Make 1 gallon of hemp milk by adding 1 quart of pure water and the an entire 8 oz package shelled hempseed to a blender bowl and blend on medium about 2 minutes (soaking 15 minutes first is optional).  Line the inside of one of the jars with the nut milk bag (hold the bag so it won't fall in) and pour the cream into the bag.  Squeeze it through the nut milk bag into one of the jars, twisting the bag to extract, then pour the strained cream back into the blender.  I added 1 teaspoon Real Salt, 1 tablespoon organic vanilla, 4 tablespoons raw agave, OR Lundberg brown rice syrup , OR a handful of high quality dates to sweeten a bit.  After blending again (more blending if using dates) pour equal amounts of the flavored cream into the two 78 ounce jars.  Add pure water to fill the jars. Seal the hermetic lid properly.  They keep for a few days and I can gently shake the jar before opening and serving to reincorporate.<br /><br />This way makes 16 - 8 ounce servings of my own hemp milk, the same strength as commercial hemp milk.  Just calculating the hemp in each 8 ounce bag gives totals of 1360 calories, 108g fats, 20g carbs, 16g fiber, 84g proteins.  Making 16 eight ounce servings in a gallon means each serving (just the hemp numbers) is 85 calories, 6.75g fat, 1.25g carb, 1g fiber, 5.25g protein. I used the average of Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest brand nutrition facts for these figures.  As ready as packaged quarts of hemp milk are now I no longer have to carry in heavy cases of premade milk and throw away all those containers.  And it only takes me 5 minutes to make milk.<br /><br />Compared to a commercial quart this milk is fresher, it tastes 'greener', smells like cut grass but doesn't taste it, and the milk is still very 'nutty' in flavor, just as smooth and creamy.<br /><br />You can make a heavy cream to drink or use in smoothies by doubling the hempseed OR halving the water. "Banana Milk" with hemp cream or hemp milk and a banana is awesome. Nutiva and Manitoba Harvest have recipes on their websites.<br /><br />I have started buying the Manitoba Harvest 25# tubs of shelled hempseed.  It is not labeled organic.  But, as hempseed needs no chemicals to grow wonderfully, and it is NON GMO, eco farmed without insecticides or pesticides I have no problems with it not having a label. I store it in the deep freeze in divided portions.  The savings on Amazon is incredible.  The 25# tub is about $136 on the s/s program.  It is 500 oz and costs 27 cents per ounce. So if I use 8 ounces to a gallon of milk I've spent $2.16. That's $.54 per quart! I used to pay $4 per quart at Whole Foods!<br /><br />Please study hemp and its benefits over dairy.  Of course you may have thought you needed dairy for the protein and calcium.  I grew up in Iowa, I was taught that, I was a huge milk drinker.  I had even seen the reality of dairy/beef processing but ignored it.  When breastfeeding (the best milk I could give my son) he was spitting up/vomiting every feed I realized the urgent need to stop drinking it.  Now at 5 years just a splash of skim milk on his arm will give him red boils and blotches.  Soy milk is out too, even if he could drink it hemp is better.  We do sometimes have homemade organic brown rice milk and organic NON GMO gluten free oat milk.<br /><br />I hope you explore hemp milk yourself!  You will save money, and no driving to the store for every gallon of milk you drink, or recycling or waste, plus think of the health benefits.  Share what you know with others so we can become growers and not just consumers of this wonderful superplant.
