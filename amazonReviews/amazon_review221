I am always looking for an alternative sweetener to get away from fructose. Most of the artificial sweeteners on the market are terrible for your health - I will name splenda as one of the worse. Stevia is made directly from the dried leaves of the Stevia plant so that is acceptable, but I find it kind of bitter and it is very expensive. You can google "xylitol benefits" and get all kinds of interesting information, but I will just reiterate some of the very interesting benefits I found when googling:<br /><br />Xylitol is a natural sugar alcohol that has been recognized by dentists and health professionals worldwide as a great alternative to white sugar.<br /><br />Commonly found in chewing gum and breathmints, Xylitol is known to have a many health benefits associated with its use.<br /><br />1. Safe For Diabetics<br />Unlike sugar, xylitol is not easily converted to fat. Because it is not easily converted to fat, it has almost no effect on insulin levels, making it a safe sugar alternative for diabetics, body builders, dieters, pregnant/nursing women, and also for babies and children.<br /><br />2. Helps Prevent Cavities<br />Since it is a non-fermentable sugar, it cannot be converted to acid by oral bacteria. Thus, the alkaline-acid balance in the mouth is maintained, which helps in preventing cavities.<br /><br />3. Helps Prevent Ear Infections<br />Xylitol can also be used as medicine in prohibiting certain bacterial growth to help prevent ear infections in young children. It will also help clear out earwax and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria in the pharyngotympanic tubes, connecting the nose and ear.<br /><br />4. Slows the Growth of Candida<br />Xylitol helps prevent bad breath, ulcers, and stomach cancer by slowing down the growth of Candida Albicans (a serious yeast infection), and other harmful bacteria like H. pylori.<br /><br />5. May Improve Bone Density<br />According to research from the University of Oulu in Finland, xylitol was shown to help improve bone density in rats. This indicates it has potential as a treatment for osteoporosis in humans. For optimal bone health, it is recommended that you eat foods high in calcium or take a calcium supplement.<br /><br />6. Helps Tooth Enamel & Strength<br />In addition to preventing cavities, consuming xylitol in small amounts helps decrease plaque formation, and promotes salivation to prevent "dry mouth", which aids in enhancing mineral absorption for repairing damaged tooth enamel, while increasing tooth strength.<br /><br />7. Increases White Blood Cell Activity<br />Xylitol, when taken in small amounts, can help increase the white blood cell activity in fighting bacterial infections, to help build immunity, protect against chronic degenerative disease and have anti-aging benefits.<br /><br />8. Prevents Streptococcus mutans In Newborns<br />When used by nursing mothers on a regular basis, it helps reduce the transmission of Streptococcus mutans (oral bacteria that causes cavities) to children by up to 80% during the first two years.<br /><br />9. May Help With Allergies & Sinus Infection's<br />When used as a nasal spray, xylitol is said to be able to help reduce the prevalence of sinus infections, asthma and allergies. It helps decrease the amount of harmful bacteria that may be in the cells of our nose.<br /><br />10. May Lower Risk of Ovarian Cysts<br />Xylitol may help lower your risk of developing ovarian cysts, polycystic ovarian syndrome (a condition that disrupts or stops the ovulation cycle), fibroids, endometriosis, premenstrual syndrome and possibly breast cancer.<br /><br />So, there appear to be a lot of benefits. For negatives, there are a couple. If you are looking for xylitol on the market, you will find that most of the xylitol offerings come from corn sources. Now, almost all corn is GMO and I personally stay away from genetically modified food. So,  looking for xylitol from some other source, I ran across this brand which uses organic birch trees. The other negative is that xylitol can cause gas in some people. It really bothers my wife, so she stays away from it in food. It does make me a little gassy, but if you use it in small amounts, it appears to be fine. I like to use it in mixed alcoholic drinks instead of sugar. I tried to slip some into some muffins I made, but my wife detected the after-effects, so she put a kibosh on that use around the house.<br /><br />So, it is kind of expensive, but this 1.5 lbs will get you by if you use it to sweeten coffee, mixed drinks, etc. It does taste pretty close to regular sugar and it does have some health benefits as stated above. I like it in muffins and other baked goods - I just have to eat whatever I make by myself since the wife does not like the after-effects. If you are a non-GMO person, then this is the brand for you.
