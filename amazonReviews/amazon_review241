I should let you know what I usually drink for coffee. I like bold, dark roasted Indonesian coffees. I usually drink a particular blend from Starbucks, what they call Komodo Dragon.  I've found other coffees that I like, from various sources, but this particular coffee can be drunk black, unsweetened, and it is missing a layer of nasty bitterness that is pretty uniform in Central American washed coffees.  About the only new world coffees that are missing some of this nasty layer are Brazils - Santos has its own problems but the layer of bitterness that the Central American washed coffees have is at least partially gone.<br /><br />That coffee is a blend that has changed over time.  At its height, it was a five star coffee, now it varies between 4.5 and 4.75 stars, not reaching 5 stars anymore, but almost everything else is just so bad that I can't drink it.  I've had other Indonesian blends, they are missing the nasty bitterness that you find in so much of the standard coffee that many people just love, and which are highly rated.<br /><br />What Komodo Dragon does have, on its better days, is depth, complexity. There is a bold coffee flavor, of course, but there are other things going on. When I drink it, the second sip is different from the first one. The third sip is different from the second.<br /><br />So I was prepared to hate this coffee, and then after a couple of sips of this coffee, I was prepared to like it...and it just left me...wanting...something, some depth, some complexity.  The best coffees - again, my favorite Indonesians, have more than just coffee flavor. As you sip the coffee, there is coffee flavor, and then there is another layer of flavor, like when you drink a good single malt islay scotch, or a fine port that has cost you 50 bucks for a bottle and you don't regret it, even if you only can afford to buy a couple bottles a year...there is grape and then there is fruit, berries, flowers, fields of heather for Scotch, or groves of cork trees for Port.<br /><br />With coffee, there are faults, like if you can smell the shed, or the burlap sack that the coffee was moved in, and then there are positives, like when there is a layer of chocolate in the coffee and you have not put any chocolate in, or when there is a satiety factor - you drink a cup of black coffee and it is so flavorful, so complex that you start hungry and you end not hungry.<br /><br />Now this coffee is workmanlike - it has coffee in it, the blend has almost no bad flavors, no flaws. It is actually missing a lot of the bad flavors, bitterness, that I dislike in Central American washed coffee that everyone drinks in ground coffee these days. And if I went into a restaurant, I would be pleased to get a cup of coffee of this quality.<br /><br />But in terms of possibly replacing the coffee I drink everyday? No, not yet.  Do NOT get me wrong. I do get acid stomach, acid reflux some time. If my acid reflux was caused by coffee, and I could drink this without it kicking my acid into high gear, I would thank my lucky stars that I had stumbled into a coffee of this quality that I could drink.<br /><br />Many years ago, there was a commercial low acid coffee, it was sold under the Kava brand (It was not the mildly narcotic drink from Fiji. Not <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0892817267">Kava: The Pacific Elixir: The Definitive Guide to Its Ethnobotany, History, and Chemistry</a>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SAVJ4W">Kava, Instant Coffee, 4-Ounce (12 Pack)</a>). I see that it is still available, at least as instant coffee. It is as bad as any instant coffee is, with no redeeming social value other than it is a low acid coffee, suitable for people who love coffee and can't drink it.<br /><br />This is a HUGE step up from that.<br /><br />So that is how this coffee gets four stars.  On the scale of acid neutralized coffees I know about, there is Kava, which might or might not be mostly Vietnamese Robusta, and then there is this stuff, which, if all you had tasted was American supermarket instant coffee, or stuff like Maxwell House<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C4BOHK">Maxwell House French Roast (Medium Dark) Ground Coffee, 33-Ounce Jugs (Pack of 2)</a>, would be nectar of the gods.<br /><br />I can't give it 5 stars, though. A five star coffee is going to have complexity, it is going to have depth, it is going to have a wonderous deep, level that is as much more than coffee as a fine single malt is more than Jack Daniels.<br /><br />If coffee were whiskey, this coffee is more than Jack Daniels, but it is sort of Canadian Club.  It stops short of the heights that it would take for me to rate it five stars - nothing bad, but nothing exceptionally good.
