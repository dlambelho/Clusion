I used Imagine Rice beverages for many years. I favored them for high quality ingredients, excellent flavor, reasonable price, and wide availability. I find milk and soy products cause digestive distress, rice beverages have no such effect, no cholesterol, very little fat, and taste great. Enriched has extra nutrition and is organic.<br /><br />However, Imagine now uses the cheaper canola oil in their rice milk products, including their Heart-Wise line of products. Canola oil contains erucic acid, a known toxic long-chain fatty acid. The USA FDA has limited canola oil to no more than 2% erucic acid to protect our health, and does not allow it in infant formula. In addition, medical studies show the erucic acid it contains is toxic to humans and animals in high enough amounts (see below). I have not been able to find any long term longitudinal controlled studies on humans to prove its safety as far as all the adversely affected organs.<br /><br />Because there have been Internet rumors about Canola that are based on misinformation, I provide some citations of scientific papers and government publications at the end of this review. This is a highly controversial subject, but concerns can be based on genuine medical research and not simply superstition, gullibility or hysteria. The FDA still approves at this time PABA food containers for people and infants, but they are not allowed in Canada due to documented toxic effects; this (and a hundred other examples) shows that FDA approval is not always the last word in food safety!<br /><br />Good Karma Whole Grains Ricemilk is organic and also canola and sugar free. It has a thicker, richer and creamier body and flavor, less watered down. The vanilla flavor is a delicious drink. Westsoy Rice Beverage has similar consistency to Rice Dream, but is canola free. I find it to be less sweet, less chalky, and more milk-like in flavor. The least expensive canola free rice milk I have found is Whole Foods "365" brand, which is more watery than other brands but tastes fine. (Some of the Good Karma products on Amazon have canola listed as an ingredient, but I believe that is outdated information. The Good Karma website and the products themselves do not list canola as an ingredient at this time.) I use "365" for cooking because it is inexpensive, and Good Karma for drinking straight because of its rich milk flavor and texture. The Good Karma chocolate flavor is super delicious and is very sweet, but unfortunately contains cane sugar rather than rice-based sweeteners.<br /><br />Some Imagine products and all the Good Karma products are also organic and made from whole grain (that is, brown) rice. Some Imagine products and some Good Karma products (the chocolate drink) contain cane sugar, which is a high glycemic sweetener, rather than a rice-based sweetener. There may be some Imagine rice milk products that are canola free, you have to check the labels, and it changes with time.<br /><br />The same canola issues (and cane sugar considerations) also apply to the Imagine frozen desert products. Good Karma makes rice-based frozen deserts that are probably canola free.<br /><br />[Health effects in humans shown to result from, or statistically linked to (different than caused by), erucic acid (_not_ Canola oil) in various medical research papers, review articles, and toxicology textbooks, include decreasing red blood cell count and autism. In animal studies there are many more documented effects of erucic acid including heart lesions and distortions of mitochondria. These studies can easily be found in the medical literature. They do not prove that the amounts of canola oil consumed by people will cause health problems, and the FDA has ruled that oil containing not more than 2% erucic acid is safe for human consumption except for infants.]<br /><br />Studies on erucic acid in rats and piglets show heart lesions, decreased red blood cell count, and other tissue and organ damage. Erucic acid crosses the blood-brain barrier and is known to affect nerve cells. It's not safe for infants by US FDA regulation.
