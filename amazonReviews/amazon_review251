Update on June 23, 2012:  I just discovered that Vitamin Squeeze tastes great when added to tonic water and ice.  (See the photograph that I have posted on this website.)  It reminds me of the fruit punch one drinks at a reception for a wedding, graduation, anniversary or other special event.  Tonic water costs about the same as bottled water.  Buy the generic brand.  Tonic water is carbonated water that is usually sweetened with fructose corn syrup, the same sweetener that is used in fruit drinks.  Vitamin Squeeze and tonic water is still healthier than sodas.  The brand of tonic water that I buy has 90 calories per serving.<br /><br />*******************************<br /><br />I suffer from chronic sinusitis; therefore, I shouldn't drink carbonated sodas because they increase my sinus congestion.  Another good reason why I shouldn't drink them is because I am prone to cavities.  However, I get tired of drinking only water.  Fortunately, my dentist recommended that I drink flavored water.  Normally, I use the MIO Liquid Water Enhancers.  My favorite flavor is the MIO Sweet Tea [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004E4HUMY">MIO Sweet Tea, 1.62-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].  It tastes like real ice tea whereas the other flavors remind me too much of the artificial, sugary-sweet Kool-Aid products I drank as a child [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ50U4">Kool-aid Tropical Punch Soft Drink Mix, 82.5-Ounce Canisters (Pack of 2)</a>].<br /><br />  I was excited to receive the Vitamin Squeeze Water Enhancer from the Amazon Vine Program.  I'm been using it faithfully for over a month.  First of all, it reminds me very much of the MIO products.  However, whereas the MIO products are more travel-size, the Vitamin Squeeze is more suitable for home use.  Vitamin Squeeze's larger 12 ounce size is more economical than MIO's 1.62 ounces.  I work at a shipyard where the water tastes foul.  I usually bring my own drinking water into the office.  I purchase various sizes of Deer Park water as shown in the photograph I've posted on this website.  Before I leave home for work, I squirt three drops of the Vitamin Squeeze into the 500 ml bottle or five drops into the 750 ml one.  The fruit punch flavor is a pleasant respite; however, when my bottle of Vitamin Squeeze is empty, I plan on buying the peach green tea flavor [<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006MONQP4">Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink, Peach Green Tea, 12-Ounce (Pack of 4)</a>].<br /><br />  Unlike soft drinks, a serving of Vitamin Squeeze has 120% RDA of Vitamin C.  (A serving size equals one squeeze per eight ounces of water.)  Vitamin C is a natural antibiotic that boosts your immune system and helps ward off flus and colds and fight infections, such as a sinus infection.  Each serving also has 40 mg of caffeine which is about equal to that of a soft drink.  However, instant coffee has 65 to 100 mg of caffeine per eight ounce serving; brewed coffee has 80 to 135 mg; and Starbucks Grande Coffee (16 oz) has a hefty 330 mg.  The Vitamin Squeeze has Vitamins B6, B5, B3 and B12 (40% RDA of each), which give you energy.  Honestly, I haven't noticed any difference in my energy levels since drinking this product.  If you want to increase your energy level, the best thing you can do is get more sleep at night.  There are also zinc and chromium (10% RDA), which also boost your immune system.  Like Gatorade, the Vitamin Squeeze also contains electrolytes which aid in recuperation after exercising, especially jogging.<br /><br />  I store my Vitamin Squeeze in my refrigerator in order to maintain freshness.  The first couple of weeks I noticed red stains on the bottom of the refrigerator shelf.  However, using a soapy sponge, I was able to easily wipe them away.  The bottle is comfortable to grip while quickly squirting drops into the Deer Park containers.  I cap the bottles and shake them and the water enhancer is easily dispersed throughout the water.  There is not a horrible aftertaste.  I am reminded of the Kool-Aid I drunk as a child.  Nevertheless, the Vitamin Squeeze is a healthier, more economical alternative to soft drinks.  It is good to use in large bottles of water that you plan to take to work, church or the gym.  Bottled water always comes in handy when I'm walking through my apartment complex or rehearsing in choir.  (I've also sipped on water that was enhanced with Vitamin Squeeze while I relaxed in a bubble bath.)  It is wise to keep a bottle of Vitamin Squeeze at home and at work.  For traveling to restaurants, church, social gatherings, etc., then I recommend the smaller MIO products; they fit easier inside one's purse or backpack.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos
