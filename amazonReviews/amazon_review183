Chef Michael's Sirloin Steak dog food is candy for dogs. They, mine included, seem to snarf it up like kids love junk food.  The problem is that it IS junk food. It's filled with ingredients that should be avoided but are likely to be highly palatable to dogs and may also be appealing to their owners. Doesn't Grilled Sirloin Steak sound yummy?<br /><br />Let's start with the easy part, price. I feed my dog dry Eukanuba. To compare,  Chef Michel's costs 14 cents an ounce vs. 9.4 cents an ounce for Eukanuba. It is even more expensive considering that it contains 2% more moisture than Eukanuba.<br /><br />Now, what's the problem with the ingredients in Chef Michael's?  Here's the list of what's in it:<br /><br />Beef,  soybean meal,  soy flour,  animal fat preserved with mixed-tocopherols (form of Vitamin E), brewers rice,  soy protein concentrate,  corn gluten meal,  ground yellow corn, glycerin,  poultry by-product meal, ground wheat, animal digest, pearled barley, calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate, salt, grilled sirloin steak flavor, dried green beans, dried potatoes, sulfur, Vitamin E supplement, choline chloride, zinc sulfate, ferrous sulfate, added color (Red 40, Blue 2, Yellow 5, Yellow 6), niacin, wheat flour, potassium chloride, L-Lysine monohydrochloride, manganese sulfate, Vitamin A supplement, calcium pantothenate, thiamine mononitrate, copper sulfate, riboflavin supplement, Vitamin B-12 supplement, pyridoxine hydrochloride, garlic oil, Vitamin D-3 supplement, folic acid, calcium iodate, menadione sodium bisulfite complex (source of Vitamin K activity), biotin, sodium selenite.<br />Here are the questionable ingredients, in order of volume in contents:<br /><br />Soybean Meal and Soy Flour: the second and third largest ingredients in Chef Michael's. After removing most of the oil from soybeans by a solvent or mechanical extraction process, grinding the remaining flakes gives you "soybean meal." "Soy flour" is another byproduct of soybean processing. These are cheap sources of protein filler used to boost the protein content of dog foods. This type of protein does not provide the dog with as much usable protein as does fish, chicken, lamb, beef or other meats. All proteins are not equal in value to the dog.<br /><br />Animal Fat: the fourth largest ingredient, according to the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO), animal fat in dog food is obtained from the tissues of mammals and/or poultry in the commercial processes of rendering or extracting. This means ANY animals, including the "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse. This is NOT a quality ingredient.<br /><br />Brewers Rice: the fifth ingredient, is the small milled fragments of rice kernels left after milling whole rice.  Although it has calories, it has little nutritional value.<br /><br />Soy Protein Concentrate: what remains of soybeans after removing the water soluble carbohydrates from the beans.  Similar to soybean meal and flour, this is an inexpensive way to boost protein, but contains a very low quality of protein.<br /><br />Corn Gluten Meal: yet, another plant-based protein booster. Gluten is the residue remaining after corn has had most of its starchy carbohydrate washed out of it.  It has little nutritional value, and is used mainly as a filler and binder.<br /><br />Corn: an inexpensive filler with little nutritional value for the dog.<br /><br />Poultry Byproduct Meal: a dry rendered product of slaughterhouse waste made from what's left of slaughtered poultry after all the prime cuts have been removed.  This includes almost anything left after the actual meat has been removed: organs (the nourishing part), feet, beaks, undeveloped eggs -- anything except quality skeletal muscle (real meat). Although, by-product meals are meat concentrates and contain nearly 300% more protein than fresh poultry, they are less digestible than chicken meat. Also, there is absolutely no control over the quality and consistency of poultry and other meat byproducts.<br /><br />Wheat: See the comments for corn, above.<br /><br />Animal Digest: a broth made of animal by-products that is usually sprayed onto the dry kibble to improve its taste.  Although it cannot contain hair, horns, teeth, hooves and feathers, except in such trace amounts as might occur unavoidably in good factory practice, it is made of unspecified parts of unspecified animals. As with animal fat, there is no control over quality or contamination and may include "4-D animals" (dead, diseased, disabled, or dying prior to slaughter), goats, pigs, horses, rats, roadkill, animals euthanized at shelters and restaurant and supermarket refuse.<br /><br />Artificial Colorings: solely to appeal to the dog owner. These ingredients are of no nutritional value and are controversial.<br /><br />Menadione: a controversial form of vitamin K linked to liver toxicity, allergies and the abnormal break-down of red blood cells.  It is unnecessary in dog food.
