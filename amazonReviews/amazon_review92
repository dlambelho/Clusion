Like some of the other reviewers, I did a lot of research before deciding on this food. (Want your eyes opened? Read "7 Scary Things You Didn't Know about Your Pet's Food." But if you're reading about this product, you probably are already aware of the low quality of grocery store cat foods.) My cat is a dry food addict and though I've tried every (healthy) suggestion out there, I cannot convince him that wet food is anything other than a snack. So I decided to at least feed him the healthiest dry food that I can afford rather than Meow Mix.<br /><br />There are some better dry cat foods, but they are only a little bit better and they're a lot more expensive. Some of them cost $10 a pound. At that price, I'd be better off feeding my cat from the meat department at the grocery store. Free range, organic chicken doesn't even cost $10 a pound. (Amusingly I just spotted where Amazon.com claims a list price for the 6 pound bag of the Chicken Soup Cat Senior as $149.49. That's $24.92 a pound!! You could feed your cat steak for less than that.)<br /><br />This is a high quality cat food with an ingredient list to put a smile on your face. For what you're getting, the price is reasonable though it's still more than the Meow Mix. The product is not carried locally. So I was happy when I found it on Amazon.com, as since this item qualifies for free shipping, that is what makes it affordable to me. (If I had to pay the over $14 shipping on it, I'd be better off going to the pet store and buying Blue Buffalo at $2.29 a pound. With the free shipping the Chicken Soup is $1.57 a pound. Without the free shipping it's $2.36 a pound.)<br /><br />Those were my reasons for choosing Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul from Amazon.com.<br /><br />Now how did my Meow Mix loving cat feel about it? When I opened the door and carried in the first box, my cat immediately started rubbing up against it and acting all excited. I had had this plan to slowly transition the cat by mixing it with the Meow Mix. But he was so enthusiastic just at the smell that I immediately opened the box, cut open the bag and offered him a handful. He dove right in. He absolutely loved it! (Now I was bit taken aback. I was so used to multi-shape, multi-color cat food. This food has no dyes. All the kibbles are the same X-shape and they're all brown.)<br /><br />I never did finish that last bag of Meow Mix. I just started putting 100% Chicken Soup in the bowl. I just ordered his third bag and he still loves it every single day.<br /><br />The cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix every so often. But I haven't seen him vomit up the Chicken Soup at all. So apparently it agrees with him better. I haven't noticed any kind of stool problem. (But to be fair, the cat didn't have diarrhea on the Meow Mix either.)<br /><br />I feed him the same amount as I did the Meow Mix: half a cup a day. I'd read that you could cut down serving size on premium foods, so I tried feeding less (also hoping it would cause him to eat more wet food) and all I ended up with was a skinny, underweight cat. So I went back to the half cup a day and the cat's back up to a healthy weight.<br /><br />The one caution I would tell you is this food is not made with artificial preservatives. I buy the big bag because it's more economical (and qualifies for the free shipping), but I only have the one cat. It takes him about 4 - 5 months to finish an 18 pound bag. (Let's see. I ordered my first bag in February. It's the end of October and he's finishing up his second bag. So, yeah, that's 4.5 months a bag.) It means the food is going to sit around for a while. So I take precautions to keep it fresh. I have a small container that I used to feed him daily; it holds about 3 weeks of food. The bulk of the food I store in a large air-tight container with a paper towel over the top of the food. Then when the small container is empty, I refill it from the large container. This keeps the food fresh for the 4 to 5 months no problem.<br /><br />Overall, the cat and I both very pleased with Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul Dry Cat Food for Adult Cat, Chicken Flavor from Amazon.com.<br /><br />EDIT: Typical cat. As if making a mockery of what I wrote, two days after I posted this, I walked into the kitchen to find where the cat threw-up this food. But it's the first time. And, bizarre as it sounds, it gave me a chance to find out something. When the cat used to throw-up the Meow Mix it always looked exactly like when it came out of the bag --- hadn't been digested at all. This food must be easier to digest because it was already broken down. It took me a minute to figure out what it was as the cat had puked directly under the trash bag and, at first, I thought the cat had torn another hole in the trash bag and something in it had fallen out.<br /><br />EDIT 2-18-12: KIBBLE SHAPE HAS CHANGED! Just opened the latest bag I ordered. It no longer has "X" shaped kibble. It's now a teeny-tiny circle, much smaller diameter than the "X" had. I admit I'm concerned as it looks small enough that the cat really won't need to chew much, if at all, before swallowing it. And if the cat doesn't chew it, how is it supposed to help keep his teeth clean? However, the cat still loves it. I checked the ingredient list with a previous bag. Found some changes in the smaller ingredients. Methionine is now listed as DL-methionine and the three Lactobacillus ingredients are now listed as dried Lactobacillus fermentation products. All the protein sources, fruits, veggies, etc are still the same and listed in the same order.
