I have added green tea to my weight loss regiment which also includes RK-500 which blocks or dissolves fat and Liponexol which does the same for carbs<br /><br />I don't exercise and being a single male a eat mostly prepared food (but I take vitamins too) my only exercise is walking my dogs twice a day and I have noticed I walk more briskly now.<br /><br />This is how I prepare the tea; I use two bags in a large mug drink that then later, on my second cup I add 1 more tea bag to the two I already used and drink that.<br /><br />One other item I have to make a plug for is I love my Nuwave tabletop oven it uses less power than a conventional over and it lets the grease and fat drip away from the food you are cooking whick is way more healthy plus you don't have to thaw out the meat prior to cooking.<br /><br />All of this is helping me lose weight. Below is some info on green tea I found on the web. And btw my comment to the reviewer who gave a one star review and complained about the taste; I don't find it repulsive at all<br /><br />What makes tea increase weight loss? According to scientific studies, it is the catechins, caffeine and theanine that makes green tea an effective weight loss tool.<br /><br />In particular, scientists have found that EGCG (the most active and abundant of catechins) and caffeine are especially important. They fight obesity in at least 7 ways.<br /><br />Method #1:<br />Boosts Metabolism<br /><br />There are 3 kinds of fat. They can be found beneath the skin, in the body organs and in the muscles.<br /><br />Brown adipose tissue is a layer of fat beneath the skin that has the ability to generate heat. Scientists found that green tea stimulates the heat burning process (called thermogenesis) much more than caffeine alone would.<br /><br />Green Tea Metabolism - How Many More Calories?<br /><br />Method #2:<br />Burns Fat<br /><br />Fat is an excellent source of energy in humans. Beta-oxidation is a process during which fat is broken down to provide energy. Scientists found that green tea burns fat by stimulating the beta-oxidation process.<br /><br />Green Tea Burn Fat<br /><br />Method #3:<br />Prevents Fat Storage<br /><br />An adipocyte cell is a fat cell or connective tissue that is involved in the synthesis and storage of fat. Scientists found that green tea prevents fat cells from multiplying and enlarging.<br /><br />In an animal study, scientists found that green tea increases weight loss by blocking the actions of enzymes involved in the synthesis and storage of fat.<br /><br />A 2006 study conducted by Donald Danforth Plant Science Center discovered that green tea may help reduce fat storage by moderating your body's production of hormone insulin. The scientists discovered that green tea does this by blocking the production of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).<br /><br />This is important because insulin plays a key part in converting glucose (blood sugar) into fat.<br /><br />Method #4:<br />Reduces Food Craving<br /><br />When you eat sugary food, your blood sugar level spikes up. This triggers a large release of insulin to move the glucose out of blood into cells for storage.<br /><br />Because your body can overreact by producing too much insulin, this can cause a sharp dip in glucose level afterwards. Low sugar levels increase your cravings, hunger, and mood swings, and reduces energy level. End result? You crave more sugary food, causing the vicious cycle to repeat itself.<br /><br />Green tea, by regulating your blood sugar levels, helps to reduce food cravings and hunger pangs.<br /><br />Green Tea and Blood Sugar<br /><br />Method #5:<br />Blocks Dietary Fat Absorption<br /><br />Another green tea weight loss secret...<br /><br />Digestive enzymes act on the foods we eat so that the body can absorb them. According to a 2006 peer review study by Wolfram, green tea reduces carbohydrate and fat absorption by blocking the actions of these enzymes.<br /><br />Method #6:<br />Regulates Glucose Uptake<br /><br />A study conducted by Ashida found that drinking green tea increases the glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and reduces the glucose uptake by fat tissue.<br /><br />End result? You are able to exercise longer, which will help you burn more calories and fat. By exercising more, you develop more muscles, which will help you maintain an active lifestyle.<br /><br />Green Tea Diet and Exercise<br /><br />Method #7:<br />Synergism with Caffeine<br /><br />Ready for the final green tea weight loss magic? Now consider this: When is 1+1=3?<br /><br />Studies conducted by scientists Dulloo and Rumpler found that caffeine and catechins benefit from one another's presence. Together, they burn more calories than each compound is on its own.<br /><br />Green tea, including caffeine, greatly increases and prolongs the heat burning effect. It helps you burn more calories even when you are sleeping!<br /><br />Diet suggestion #1<br /><br />Avoid diet drinks ans sugar substitutes. That right avoid them as much as possible. Though they help prevent you from gaining weight,they also PREVENT YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #2<br /><br />Eat protein and only proteins for breakfast. This sets up your metabolism to burn fat the rest of the day. Avoid "breakfast" drinks as they contain sugar and any carbs too.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #3<br /><br />This will be the most difficult; keep the room temperature as low as you can tolerate. Your body will burn fat to maintain it's metabolism and body temp. I prefer 64 degrees.
