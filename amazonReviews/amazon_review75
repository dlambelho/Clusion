If you follow the supplied directions, you'll get an active sourdough starter within days; however, keep in mind that not all sourdough is sour, so you'll have to take some extra steps to get the San Francisco tang.  I bought this culture to add to my existing sourdough starter (which IS sour) to make the flavor more complex but ended up instead keeping two separate starters, simply because this one is so good.  Newcomers to sourdough may be disappointed with the taste until they learn the proper techniques to achieve the type of bread flavor they want.<br /><br />To begin, "sourdough" refers not to the taste, but to the method, which uses wild yeast and bacteria to create a sponge to be used in place of commercial yeast.  This culture will do exactly that.  In three days, I had such an active starter that my bread rose quickly, even in a winter-temperature house.  The bread was creamy, with an excellent crumb, although, because the starter was brand new, it tasted like white bread with a little character, something I expected but which may surprise beginners.  This was my first test of the starter to make sure it worked properly.  And it did.  Perfectly.  If you are buying this starter as a natural leavening agent and not as a sour bread maker, then skip to the last two paragraphs of this review.<br /><br />Most people who consider buying this culture will want their bread to taste sour, as it does in San Francisco.  They are not looking for a yeast substitute.  If this describes you, read on.<br /><br />San Francisco sourdough bread, with its distinctive tang, requires certain steps to enhance yeast- and bacteria-based fermentation. Here are my tips for creating a more "sour" taste using this culture:  1. When keeping the starter at room temperature, feed it less frequently once it has become established.  The instructions suggest feeding once every 12 hours (two feedings a day), but I find that once every 24 hours creates a more sour tasting starter.  2. Leaving the starter in the refrigerator for a week, unfed, and then pulling it back out for one feeding, then a sponge feeding 24 hours later, improves the sourness.  3. The instructions tell you to throw out all but 1/4 cup between feedings or to use 1/4 cup from your refrigerated starter.  I keep/use at least one cup, sometimes two, and give it the same amount of "food" -- 1/2 cup water and slightly less than 1 cup flour.  Just make sure that the final sponge is rising correctly before you use it. Once you get to know your starter, you'll know how much food and time it needs to fully activate.  4. Allow the shaped loaves to rise in the refrigerator overnight or up to 24 hours to allow for more fermentation.  As the yeast and bacteria consume the available nutrients, the dough will get sticky from the alcohol by-products, so don't expect to handle it again.  5. If you are using a bread machine to knead the dough, use the French bread setting since that will lengthen the kneading/rising time, OR, if you are kneading by hand or mixer, complete two full risings.  6. Hot sourdough always tastes less sour than it will at room temperature.  Yes, it's difficult not to cut into the loaf right away, but try to let it cool to warm before serving.  If you always eat the bread hot out of the oven, without having leftovers, then you'll never taste the full tang.  7. If you only care about the tang and not about the rising power, check out <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/155832156X">The Bread Lover's Bread Machine Cookbook</a>.  Hensperger provides several recipes for starters and bread that are much cheaper than buying this culture.  The recipes use a combination of starter and commercial yeast, but they yield a nice sour bread.<br /><br />The key to sour bread is fermentation, so anything you can do to promote it will enhance the tang.  This includes stirring any hooch, or alcohol, back into the starter.<br /><br />Other tips for this culture:  never use chlorinated water and never store in a metal container.  I don't even use metal utensils, although this is probably overkill.  Supposedly, metal can both inhibit growth and discolor the starter.  Since sourdough starters improve over time, you can expect the flavor to improve with every passing week, provided that you care for it.  If you follow the instructions, you will have a thick starter, not as thick as a dough starter but not as liquid as a batter type.  Of course, you can make this into either type with different flour/water ratios.<br /><br />This starter arrives in dried, powdered form in a small packet.  It comes with can't-fail directions for reactivating and maintaining the starter.  You will need non-chlorinated water, unbleached flour, and a glass or plastic container that holds at least four cups.  (I use a glass Pyrex measuring cup so I can tell exactly how much starter I have.)  Plan on at least five days between first feeding and first loaf because you will need a highly active starter to properly leaven the bread.  You can revert to the 24-hour feedings once the starter rises substantially in the container.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I recently read that the lactobacillus part of the starter is what gives sourdough its tang.  The wild yeast gives the bread its rise and spring.  Lactobacilli thrive in colder temperatures (under 50 degrees F), so refrigeration may be essential to getting that sour taste, either during storage or rising. (Think of the average temperature of San Francisco!)  If you are using the starter for the first time or without storing it in the refrigerator, I highly recommend that you refrigerate the formed loaves overnight, then bring them up to room temperature for an hour or so before baking.<br /><br />-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann
