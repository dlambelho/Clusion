Wow, forget all the antioxidants it has and that, if you scan the package it's all organic and even surprisingly vegan which they don't advertise...well, you WILL forget everything healthy when you taste it. It's flat out decadent.<br /><br />I'm not even that huge of a fan of granola. Usually it tastes like things coated in high fructose corn syrup trying to hold out the name "granola" like a fake i.d. for their healthy card.<br /><br />This actually tastes homemade.<br /><br />The red berries are a great mix with the dark chocolate (monounsaturated or "good" fat and antioxidants. Monounsaturated fats have actually been shown to HELP ya lose weight and REDUCE bad cholesterol levels. Woo Hoo)<br /><br />I originally figured I'd keep this around for just a bite when I wanted something sweet...I'm ashamed to say, I polished it off in two days.<br /><br />With no milk.<br /><br />Great snacking.<br /><br />Yeah, a portion of the proceeds go to a charity...but the fact is, I simply love the taste so I'd eat it even if they didn't.<br /><br />Incidentally, it's low in sugar and high in whole grains. You won't guess this when you eat it so pretend you didn't just read that and don't tell the kids.<br /><br />And, psst, it's also filling your diet with flax seeds. Wonderful and healthy Omega-3 fatty acid rich Flax seeds are the holy grail of healthy ingredients. What have they been shown to do? Oh, I'm a big fan of flaxseeds:<br /><br />Anti-Inflammatory Benefits:  Omega-3 fats are used by the body to produce  anti-inflammatory hormone-like molecules, Omega-3 fats can help reduce the inflammation that is a significant factor in conditions such as asthma, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, migraine headaches, and osteoporosis.<br /><br />Omega-3-rich Flaxseeds Protect Bone Health:  Alpha linolenic acid, the omega-3 fat found in flaxseed and walnuts, promotes bone health by helping to prevent excessive bone turnover.<br /><br />Protection Against Heart Disease, Cancer and Diabetes:  Omega-3 fats are used to produce substances that reduce the formation of blood clots, which can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with atherosclerosis or diabetic heart disease.<br /><br />Omega-3 fats are also needed to produce flexible cell membranes. Cell membranes are the cell's gatekeepers, allowing in needed nutrients while promoting the elimination of wastes. While important for everyone, flexible cell membranes are critical for persons with diabetes and omega-3 fats have been shown to help protect colon cells from cancer-causing toxins and free radicals, leading to a reduced risk for colon cancer.<br /><br />Flaxseeds Help Prevent and Control High Blood Pressure: Individuals whose diets provide greater amounts of omega-3 such as that in flaxseeds have lower blood pressure than those who consume less, shows data gathered in the International Study of Macro- and Micro-nutrients and Blood Pressure, a study of 2,238 people<br /><br />Flaxseed Provides Comparable Cholesterol-Lowering Benefits to Statin Drugs in a study of patients with high cholesterol<br /><br />Rich in Beneficial Fiber:  A study published in the Archives of Internal Medicine confirms that eating high fiber foods, such as flaxseed, helps prevent heart disease. Almost 10,000 American adults participated in this study and were followed for 19 years.<br /><br />Flaxseed Puts the Brakes on Prostate Cancer Growth:  Flaxseed put the brakes on prostate tumor growth in men who were given flaxseed daily a month before surgery to treat their prostate cancer.<br /><br />Lead author, Duke University researcher Wendy Demark-Wahnefried, believes the omega-3s in flaxseed alter how cancer cells lump together or cling to other cells, while flaxseed's anti-angiogenic lignans choke off the tumor's blood supply, thus helping to halt the cellular activity that leads to cancer growth.<br /><br />Special Protection for Women's Health:  Flaxseed is particularly rich in lignans, special compounds that are converted by beneficial gut flora into two hormone-like substances. These agents demonstrate a number of protective effects against breast cancer and are believed to be one reason a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk for breast cancer.<br /><br />Flaxseed Reduces Hot Flashes Almost 60%, as well as many other perimenopausal symptoms.<br /><br />Flaxseeds reduced dry eye in a study of over 40,000<br /><br />I likely don't have to discuss the benefits of the organic or high fiber or antioxidant rich ingredients, right? I think those are already well-known.<br /><br />Amazing and good for you? Heck yes it is.
