I have reviewed this product before when they were the same coffee, 3 tubs, bigger size, same price.  This is a 5 star coffee.  We have tried every Columbian coffee we can find, just because for some reason, we like the flavor of Columbian coffee, no idea why.  But from the highest end coffee to the cheapest coffee we could find, this was by far our favorite, Folgers Gourmet Lively Columbian is not the same, and it doesn't come close to being as good.<br /><br />We've been drinking this specific coffee for years now (though at times we are forced to drink something else because nobody can keep it in stock) all the local stores run out constantly of Folgers Columbian. It's hardly ever in stock and we buy as much as we can.  We have the same problem with Amazon.  It's rarely in stock, when it is in stock there's always only 1,2, or 3 left, I get the email that it's in stock and that very day it says "only -- left in stock".  The worst part that makes me really mad and I don't know if it's Folgers ripping me off or Amazon but I'm really really mad that they are charging over $35 ($30 for subscribe and save - which I did, but it will probably get cancelled because they will run out of stock )for a much smaller (27.9oz) size tub than before (34.5oz)-6.6 oz less per tub - 19.8oz less for $4 more (or for the same price with S&S).<br /><br />THEN COMPARE CURRENT PRICES FOR OTHER FLAVORS: 6+oz less per tub for Columbian, over 18 oz less coffee for the same brand different flavor on the same day from the same store-AMAZON, and it is not currently in stock at my grocery stores locally so I'm stuck paying this outrageous price or changing coffee, which I have tried before and might have to try again by the looks of things.<br /><br />3 tubs of Foldgers Columbian 27.8oz each for $35 (or $30 subscribe & save)<br /><br />OR<br /><br />3 tubs Folgers Classic Roast 33.9oz each for $31.64 (regular price, not subscribe and save)<br /><br />Is Folgers charging more for Columbian and therefore AMAZON is charging more for less coffee than I used to get for the same price/sometimes less?  OR since Amazon has it flying off the shelves, they can sell the smaller tubs for the same price as they used to charge for the bigger tubs or only stock the smaller tubs and then sell them for the same price as the other flavors because it is SUCH a popular flavor?  Folgers still makes the large tubs of Columbian because I just bought them two weeks ago when my local store had a whopping two tubs in stock, for the price I am now paying for the small tub.<br /><br />Just last year, I repeatedly bought from AMAZON 3 tubs of Folgers Columbian 34.5oz each for $31.24 (regular price, not subscribe and save)<br /><br />Now I get 27.8 oz for $35/$30 for 3 tubs - that's 6.7 oz LESS FOR THE SAME PRICE BUT THE OTHER FLAVORS ARE STILL AT THE CHEAPER PRICE.  I just want to know who decided to rip off all the people who are paying for this coffee to fly off the shelves - Folgers themselves or Amazon? and IS THERE SOME LEGITIMATE REASON OR IS IT JUST BECAUSE IT'S POPULAR SO IF YOU CAN CHARGE US MORE MONEY FOR LESS PRODUCT, YOU MIGHT AS WELL.<br /><br />I am a HUGE FAN of AMAZON and have never had any problems here for many years, they have excellent, personalized customer service and make most things easier and most of the time cheaper than anywhere else.  The only problems I've read about from other people seem to be from outside/independent sellers, so I'm trying to be open minded that maybe it's Folgers, not Amazon but I am really angry that the price is (in my opinion) SKYROCKETING, for what seems to be just because they can, with no consideration for loyal Folgers and loyal Amazon customers by one company or both.<br /><br />I know, I know, I should just buy some other coffee - absolutely, it's our choice which coffee we buy, at least as long as we have a free country. I am completely against price fixing, and believe in a democratic society where the free market is a free market and businesses exist for the sole purpose of employing people and making a profit, otherwise they would all be non-profit agencies and/or charities and not employ very many people etc.  But none of that stops me from wanting to know WHY?<br /><br />If Amazon's price didn't go up, I don't think mine should by such a huge margin,or raise all the coffee a little instead of jacking up one flavor to make up for the increased cost of all coffee/production and if it's not costing Folger's this huge amount more to make the coffee, then why does it cost me that much more? Or does it suddenly cost that much more to make only Folger's brand Columbian coffee?<br /><br />Dare I ask, is Columbian coffee suddenly skyrocketing because we didn't sign the free trade agreement with Columbia? I really want to know what the heck is going on so I can start adjusting to the ridiculous price increase, or start all over again trying to find a new decent Cup Of Coffee, last time it was out of stock everywhere, I tried 8 different kinds of coffee and none of them held up.<br /><br />My rant is officially over, I need to go make another pot of coffee.  Hopefully when I come back, it won't cost more than diamonds. Just writing the review has inspired me to get to the bottom of this!<br /><br />Bottom line - great coffee, recent price jump knocks of two stars.
