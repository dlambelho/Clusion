*Note: This may seem like a shill review, but I am in no way affiliated with Flint River - I am just one happy customer (well three counting my wife and pup)! Many thanks to Chandler for enlightening me on this company and much of the info below!<br /><br />This is without a doubt the best dog food on the market. Forget all of these pet store-sold brands that use words like "plus", "pro-formula" and "healthy" - it's marketing hype and is not beneficial for your dog. After talking with Chandler (see first reviewer) my wife and I decided to give Flint River Ranch a go. We had been using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00264TMWU">Blue Buffalo Dry Food for Small Breed Dogs</a> and we were generally quite pleased. They at least used natural ingredients in beneficial amounts (meat always main ingredient) - but after reading up on the difference in meat quality used, as well as several recalls over the past 3 years, we decided it was time for a change. Chandler's helpful post has already outlined why using human-grade meat is important so I won't go over that, but to highlight one important thing every dog owner should realize: your dog is not a wild wolf! It has been domesticated over generations, changing its genetic makeup; he or she can't handle poor quality meat.<br /><br />Our pup had recently been suffering from allergies - Blue Buffalo helped a little but they were still present. As cute as it is to have our little pup bound up to us with a runny nose every now and then, we knew that she must be uncomfortable! We were going to go with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72">Newman's Own Dog Food</a> but our dog is a 24lb. whippet mix and an examination of the kibble at a friend's place showed it to be a little too big for her. So, we jumped on Flint River's website and put an order in. We were a little nervous about our picky eater - she has a hard time with  Eukanuba when visiting the in-laws, and even when we tried a different Blue Buffalo food to mix things up she was hardly enthusiastic. Luckily for us, she jumped right on her bowl of Flint River the first time around! The kibble itself is more like broken up dog biscuits:<br /><br />PROS<br />- Human-grade meat is used<br />- No artificial preservatives or fillers<br />- NO ANIMAL BY-PRODUCTS<br />- Food is twice-baked to preserve healthful properties<br />- Nicely sized, even for smaller dogs<br />- Food has never been recalled<br />- Customer Service far exceeds expectations<br />- Our dog seemed to love it<br /><br />"CONS"<br />- Price<br /><br />I put "cons" in parentheses because while you are paying more for your food, you are (a) looking out for your buddy which in my mind is worth it, and (b) you may be saving money of vet visits down the road. Dogs are genetically quite similar to humans. If a person takes care of themselves by eating well and exercising often, doctor's visits are only necessary for injuries and check-ups (at least in my experience). The same goes with dogs and vet visits!<br /><br />Listen, no dog food is going to magically make your dog run like a greyhound and pull people out of burning buildings like Lassie, but smart choices lead to a better life for your pup. Heck, we don't even know how old our dog is (looks like a puppy but has some grey on the muzzle), but we want to invest in her life by making good choices! Nothing irks me more than reviews on pet food that say "My dog didn't like this food, ONE STAR!" - your dog can't smell what food is best for them. Give it time, allow them to get used to this food and for their body to reap some of the benefits, and I hope you will find it as worth it as we did! We have only been using it for a few weeks now, but I will updated this review in a couple of months when we really start to see the positive effects!<br /><br />IMPORTANT NOTES:<br />* Still not convinced? Flint River offers four sample meals of their food for less than five bucks shipped. Give it a try before you drop the premium price!<br />*This is actually cheaper when purchased directly from the manufacturer!<br />* Within an hour of my ordering the samples, I had two LONG emails with tips on changing my dog's diet as well as some general info on allergies. I had mentioned my dogs allergies and I got a very detailed explanation of diagnosis and treatment!<br /><br />This food is recommended by my wife and I (and our little girl, Poppy) without reservation - if you can't afford to cook fresh chicken and rice for your dog each day, this is the next best thing! Absolutely worth the price!
