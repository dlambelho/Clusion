****<br /><br />You have to take this product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), for what it is.  It is not a Pop-Tart, which is bigger and more thoroughly filled with the fruit-like substance these two food-chunks offer.<br /><br />The product under review is airy, more like a small Nerf ball than a large marble, although it is in no way spherical or useful in any games.  I was surprised that the filling did not fill the shell.<br /><br />Because the filling does not fill much of the shell much of the shell does not abut anything that's more liquid than solid, like blueberry jam compared to blueberry paste.<br /><br />****<br /><br />CRUMBLY<br /><br />Because of that much of the shell is so dry that when you take a bite of the top of it it tends to crumble rather than tear, more like a potato chip than a potao knish.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying that the typical consumer of this product cannot eventually figure out the exact measures necessary to figuring out how to eat it without spilling crumbles but I am saying there's a reason you don't see the manufacturer, Quaker, bragging all the time on how many thousands of these bars they have shipped to the International Space Station over the years where I'm pretty sure weigthlessness and the susceptibility to encroachement by crumbits into the various electronic and mechanical devices is considered more dangerous than that same degree of encroachment in the backseat of your car.<br /><br />Or even the front seat.<br /><br />****<br /><br />PACKAGING<br /><br />The package of my Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6) is interesting.  When viewed from above, the shape is not a rectangle as you would expect.  Said another way, the horizontal cross-section of the box of almost every such product, and literally millions of others, is a rectangle whereas the cross-section of this box is a parallelogram, i.e., the opposite sides are parallel but the corners are not square.<br /><br />Below is my best representation of a parallelogram, where you should observe the only the stars and not the dots, but it might not turn out right in the final version of this Amazon review.  If it doesn't ignore it.<br /><br />**********<br />.*...............*<br />..*...............*<br />...*...............*<br />....**********<br /><br />This is interesting because the curious mind wants to know why this package is different from so many others.  There must be a reason the experienced and highly paid people at Quaker made such an unusual decision.  I claim it's for one of two reasons, but it if you learn that it's for some other reason, I hope you'll take the ime to leave a comment.<br /><br />It's either because the package's odd shape was expected somehow to attract more buyers than if it were rectangular or because the shape somehow protects the bars inside from getting crushed as much during packaging and transport and shipping.<br /><br />I think it's the latter, because when the box is on a shelf in a store it looks from the front like all the others.  Not until you see it from the side or the top do you realize it's not rectangular as, as I say, so many other of its shelfmates are.<br /><br />I am not enough of an engineer to undertand exactly why this parallelogram shape would prevent the individual bars from getting crushed from the bottom big surface up more significantly or from the top big surface down more significantly but I'm convinced that's the best explanation.<br /><br />****<br /><br />This product did pass my hungry-dog test in the sense that PheyeG'hdeaux ate every little crumb or chunk I dropped onto the floor where he eagerly watched me eat the bar.  My dog is always really quite extremely eager to eat anything that might possibly be food.  He will happily partake of cat poop and dead squirrel and even broasted plamplams.  It's not much to say that this food product, Quaker Stila Crispy Oat Cookie Bar - Blueberry, 5.5-Ounce (Pack of 6), passes this test, but the fact remains that it does.<br /><br />It probably also goes without saying, but when you duct-tape one of these bars to a stick of dynamite and detonate it, the bar is entirely disintegrated and no identifiable pieces remain within a radius of 10 yards, including any blueberries.<br /><br />Despite my curiosity about and possible admiration for the box's shape, I award this product only 4 stars, and the reason is its flatulence, by which I mean how flat the filling is relative to the higher top crust of the bar.  If you want this "crispy" this is it, but I don't.<br /><br />****<br /><br />Update of August 10, 2012<br /><br />Bernadettes's comment got me to thinking there's more to say about the box's extremely uncommon shape.<br /><br />One thing is that storing it next to more normally shaped containers in a pantry is slightly more difficult.<br /><br />More interesting is that this box has a shape that is perhaps better suited for stowing in, say, a backpack.  The height cannot be changed, of course, but if you turn a rectangular prism into this parallelogram you do add to the width (the side to side dimension) but you can shrink the depth (the front to back dimension) significantly, which might well make it fit more easily into certain containers such as a backpack or a motorcycle saddlebag or your kangaroo's pouch.<br /><br />And yet another reason is that this shape prevents storing the box on either of its two sides, which is the one orientation of the three that would be most likely to crush the bars inside which, as I've already said, would result in significant damage to them.  If you store the box flat on either large surface or on either end, the damage will be less.  I don't know that this is the manufacturer's reason, but it makes sense either way.<br /><br />If you can invent yet another reason the box is shaped this way, do leave a comment.
