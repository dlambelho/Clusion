I treat my animal's health as if it were my own and try to not only find the best veterinarian care, but also the best foods.  I've had my dog Brandy on Eagle brand dog food for many years.  I remember when there was the melanine scare, but I didn't have to worry because all of the ingredients were natural and were grown in the United States.  Aside from that, once I changed from an inexpensive food with suspect ingredients, there was a very noticeable difference in her general appearance, especially her fur.  It became sleek and ultra shiny and her body slim and trim.<br /><br />Brandy is now eleven years old and although I cannot credit Eagle for her health, she has had only one minor incident that she's had to be taken to the vet's for outside of regular checkups.  My veterinarian wholeheartedly approves of her diet and is pleased that even though she's getting to be an old girl, she's amazingly healthy.  I used to use another Eagle brand, but since she's getting older,  I switched to the senior brand.  She's getting a tad chunky, but her activity level has changed.  Brandy still is frisky and I do believe a good diet has a lot to do with it.<br /><br />When my vet called me the other day with some test results from another dog, I asked her about the corn in this food.  Everyone is yelling about corn being a poor and unhealthy filler so I couldn't resist asking.  She simply said that she considered corn a vegetable and had little bad to say about it.  In other words, a not to worry situation.  My dog is happy, healthy, and I heartily recommend Eagle Pack Senior for all older dogs.<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Chicken Meal, Ground Brown Rice, Ground Yellow Corn, Oatmeal, Chicken Fat (Preserved with Natural Mixed Tocopherols), Pork Meal, Brewers Dried Yeast, Dried Beet Pulp, Anchovy & Sardine Meal, Flaxseed, Dried Egg Product, Wheat Germ Meal, Potassium Chloride, Carrots, Peas, DL-Methionine, Vitamins [Vitamin A Supplement, Vitamin D-3 Supplement, Vitamin E Supplement, Riboflavin Supplement, Vitamin B-12 Supplement, d-Calcium Pantothenate, Niacin Supplement, Pyridoxine Hydrochloride, Thiamine Mononitrate, Folic Acid, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Biotin], Minerals [Polysaccharide Complexes of Zinc, Iron, Manganese and Copper, Cobalt Carbonate, Potassium Iodate, Sodium Selenite], Choline Chloride, Dried Kelp, Lecithin, Rosemary Extract, Glucosamine Hydrochloride, Yucca Schidigera Extract, Dried Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus oryzae and Aspergillus niger Fermentation Products, Mixed Tocopherols (a natural preservative).<br /><br />GUARANTEED ANALYSIS:<br /><br />Crude Protein (min.)  26%<br /><br />Crude Fat (min.)  12%<br /><br />Crude Fiber (max.)  3.00%<br /><br />Moisture  (max.)  10.00%<br /><br />Calcium (min.)  1.00%<br /><br />Phosphorus (min.)  0.080%<br /><br />Vitamin A  (min.)  22,000 IU/kg<br /><br />Vitamin E  (min.)  165 IU/kg<br /><br />Ascorbic Acid (min.)  30 mg/kg<br />(Vitamin C)*<br /><br />Omega 6 Fatty (min.)  2.40%<br />Acids *<br /><br />Omega 3 Fatty (min.)  0.60%<br />Acids*<br /><br />Glucosamine  (min.)  340 mg/kg<br />Hydrochloride<br /><br />Total Lactic Acid  (min.)  100,000,000<br />Microrganisms*<br /><br />(Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium in equal amounts)<br />*Not recognized as an essential nutrient by the AAFCO Dog Food Nutrient Profiles<br />Eagle Pack Senior Adult Dog Food is formulated to meet the nutritional levels established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) Dog Food Nutrient Profiles for maintenance.<br /><br />FEEDING GUIDELINES (from the website):<br /><br />Transitioning to Eagle PackÂ®<br />It is important to slowly transition your dog from his/her current diet as it takes a few days for the body to adapt to the new nutrient levels. To transition, gradually mix in the new food over a 5-7 day period, increasing the amount of Eagle Pack each day, so that you are feeding 100% Eagle Pack by day 7.<br /><br />Determining Feeding Portions<br /><br />Looking at the chart, divide the total cups per day by the total number of times you feed your dog per day to determine the portion size for each meal. Keep a clean bowl of fresh water available at all times. Eagle Pack believes in feeding dry and wet food in combination whenever possible to help increase the level of water in your dog's diet.<br /><br />Recommended Feeding Portions<br /><br />(based on a standard 8 oz dry measuring cup)<br />Every dog is different so optimal feeding amounts may vary with age, size, activity level, breed and environment.
