I bought the Dolce Gusto machine in 2008, and have been an avid fan of the machine and the capsules ever since.<br />While I do have a couple pointers (not quite complaints, but advice to make your Dolce Gusto experience better) that pertain to the machine itself -- and thus the final coffee product -- I feel the capsules themselves are not at fault for any of the machine's problems.<br />After many days of getting used to the machine, I've found that loosely following the recommended milliliter measurements  on the boxes is a good start, and from there it's up to you. Personally, I do just the recommended amount of milk and then pour the espresso until I see the tiniest hint of transparency in the flow. From there I wait anywhere from half a minute to a few minutes (the longer you wait, the more espresso left in the capsule makes it's way to the bottom ready to get the last flush of hot water...but at the same time, the more the foam melts into the coffee), depending on what other busy morning activities I've gotten myself into while preparing the drink, and then push another few seconds worth of espresso out of the capsule. Does this make a world of difference in strength? I doubt it...but it gives me just that much darker of a drink and it makes me feel like I'm getting the most bang for my buck.<br />Ofcourse, the fact that I can get that much more espresso out of the capsule by waiting a bit isn't necessarily all the capsule's fault, but it is truly my only caveat (I also wonder if it's possible to make recyclable capsules...). Either way, unless I've really overdone the amounts of milk or espresso (or haven't gotten back to the machine in time to turn it off), getting a 'watered-down' cappuccino is not possible and, in my opinion, purely an 'operator problem' (see tip above).<br />Also something to note: a generally accepted typical single shot of espresso is made up of 8g of ground coffee and the final product shouldn't be any more than 35mL. The instructions on the package tell you to pour about 40mL (and there is exactly 8g of espresso in the capsule). In other words, if you overdo the espresso capsule, you'll be getting a noticeably watered down espresso (as for the whole cappuccino, I usually can't tell if I've overdone it a touch).<br />Guests have always commented on the excellent look (use clear glasses for quite the show), feel, and taste of the foam and milk. I have to agree that compared to using other capsule-based machines where one has to purchase an extra milk-frother (and deal with the clean-up, supplies, etc), this system easily produces a comparable (at least) milk and foam experience, with very little hassle (if any).<br /><br />When it comes to flavors, there's been a long-standing tie between Cappuccino and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001H0FI0O">Latte Macchiato</a> in my household. We tend to always have a supply of Cappuccino around with the occasional box of Macchiatto every month or two. Cappuccino is definitely a favorite. Top notch. Never had a problem with a bad after-taste, or at least nothing but the great taste of good espresso.<br />For those who like to know where their coffee comes from: the milk is from France and the coffee capsules are from England (although the actual 100% ground and roasted arabica beans themselves, I don't know). Also, there's 8g of ground coffee in the espresso capsules (the Latte Macchiato has less -- in fact, the Macchiato box recommends 50mL of espresso for a capsule that contains 6.5g...in other words, the amount of espresso that you'd find in a fairly small single shot with the amount of water reserved for a small double shot...perhaps one of the reasons I tend to prefer the Cappuccino).<br /><br />And ofcourse, buying the boxes from Amazon.com with the subscribe and save is the most inexpensive option I've found.<br />Also, make sure to sign-up online at Dolce Gusto's website for the award points you get with every box. With a box of three from Amazon (through subscribe and save), AND factoring in the 10 award points you get with every box (with which you can redeem Amazon gift cards), the price per box drops to a little over 7 dollars (compared to ~9 dollars a box at Sur la Table and other retailers).<br />And since I'm a money-saving statistics addict, I'm especially happy about the fact that the online rewards program keeps track of all the points you've ever recorded (thus telling me how many boxes I've ever purchased). This helps me calc. how much money I've saved in total in comparison to, say, Starbucks.<br />All in all, if you're not quite willing to shell out major bucks for a real espresso machine, and have limited counter-space to begin with, the Dolce Gusto machine is an easy choice (they just released new and improved versions, too). **And, as of early October '10, they've revamped their boxes, giving them a classier, more matte-like finish (along with a recycle symbol on the bottom) and a cleaner look in terms of pictures and text. Great improvement to the design, and a fun, refreshing face-lift.**<br /><br />In terms of capsules, the Cappuccino is a solid choice -- a staple in my cabinet.
