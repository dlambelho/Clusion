As Robert B. Parker's SPENSER would say:<br /><br />"Me, too."<br /><br />Those who have read many Spenser detective novels will have worthy clues why I used that quote as a confirmation of this product. Those who want the luxury of more clues can allow themselves the joy of reading some of that series which, among other treats, tracks eating evolution from the 70's through present day.<br /><br />[NOTE that this is done in typical RBP minimalism, meaning that the series is not a true culinary giving high focus to cooking scenes, but that those scenes which do grace this series reek of "oh yeah" balsamic flavor.]<br /><br />[At the end of this review is a link to the first book in the Spenser series.]<br /><br />Between reading splurges, a reader might consider baking his favorite recipe of meatloaf... for himself alone but not lonely [or maybe lonely], baking liberal sloshes of this ketchup all over the top and sides of it. He might skip the Jack Daniels as beverage choice this time.<br /><br />Sorry Spenser, though I admire you beyond measure, we differ in at least two counts:<br /><br />1. When I need to hold my cup with two hands it will be half full, not of bourbon, but of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002ESSASK">Cameron's Organic French Roast Whole Bean Coffee, 32-Ounce Bag</a>. My 1/8 liver function since before I was old enough to imbibe [so I couldn't/didn't] can still handle coffee, but not bourbon.<br /><br />Such is life?<br /><br />Now you [RBP] know about Life, without doubt, oh master of literary detective fiction. I'll bet you've seen a LOT from your current "residence" gracefully provided from the time of your death January, 2010.<br /><br />[The second count above is not relevant in this case, lol.]<br /><br />Returning to Annie's divine organic Ketchup...<br /><br />Even though Spenser was what I might call a balsamic gourmand [Nero Wolfe, too?]... maybe because of that, I believe he would be buying organic, no soy, no extra stuff added other than whole foods which normally and essentially make up a genuine, non-synthetic, no push recipe. I think that he would buy many of these types of products on Amazon, even though a few reviews here seem to have relished ripping [some did so with truly excellent literary sarcasm] his products' evolution of style, and His Susan. [Check out RBP's official web site to see his family photos, read and hear interviews, and listen to Bob and son singing "Moon River"!]<br /><br />On the other hand, I'm sure that Spenser, not RB, since RB like Hemingway had his reasons for not reading reviews, read and enjoyed rave reviews on his shenanigan stories captured by RB. [Yes, fictional characters, too, can read reviews, at least within my fertile mind and vicarious imagination, lol!]<br /><br />So, what [IMO] is the common ingredient in Spenser's character and Annie's product?<br /><br />It's something their human creators are aware of, from the bottom of their souls and soles of their lively feet, whether bare, gumshoed, or sandaled:<br /><br />***When you try to force INTEGRITY against itself you might meet a collection of very angry genomes [or Quantum Base Structures, QBS a la me], or a righteous army of them. The price they might extract could be ugly... Sorry! More LGS sci-fi infestation here, lol... or is X-Files bleeding through?]***<br /><br />If Robert B. Parker and Annie know anything [and they've probably assimilated a lot of knowledge], they know the LAWS OF INTEGRITY. Or they've discerned some of them over incredibly productive lifetimes. [In my view RBP's spirit still exists, still knows things, and still sees, reads... so I feel okay using present tense in reference to his consciousness.]<br /><br />To avoid [this requires tongue-in-cheek] the above starred tragedy, here's an option to pay the dues ahead of time:<br /><br />1. Order this ketchup here, right now [after you finish reading this review].<br /><br />2. Bake your favorite recipe of meatloaf [alter it slightly to "go with" this culinary ambiance if necessary] using this flavor rich tomato concoction, slathering it all over the top and sides.<br /><br />3. Put the ketchup bottle on the table so, if you need to, you can dump more onto the slices, over any bites which don't have the top layer of ketchup on them.<br /><br />4. The rest of this healing, invigorating process will instinctively take its momentum to completion, from satisfaction of the above 3 initiations of action.<br /><br />5. If you need something to spark this process, read the product ingredients lists, and gleeful customer reviews.<br /><br />As restaurant servers sometimes say to irritate me even when I like them, ENJOY!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0440129613">The Godwulf Manuscript (#1 in Robert B.
