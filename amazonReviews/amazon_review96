Dang it! I've been l@@king literally everywhere for these blasted eye balls so I can prepare the WEIRD HALLO-CAKE! What I do with these is I freeze them, they are part of the cake decor; the "ooey, gooey, sm'ooey" cakey!<br /><br />It isn't a hard thing to make but really fun even for those "moms who works but really would love to make a creepy cake for their kids" to "grandma's (or Aunts, Cousin Itt - oops LOL!) has more tricks up her sleeves than you can imagine" ... It's true - those who've borne children automatically DO have eyeballs in the back of their heads - HEE HEE HEE!  HERE'S THE RECEIPE (cheat sheet):<br /><br />1) Store bought Angel Food Cake - turn it upside down - use toothpicks to mark 2 inches above (remember cake is upside down) from bottom - pushing it through every 6 to 8 inches all around if you have good EYES. Using non-flavored, waxed dental floss - cut the bottom end off (provides you a faster and cleaner cut in a sawing motion slowly) just above the toothpicks.<br /><br />2) Lift cake, leave base (bottom) on the store bought base and cover with lid and set aside.<br /><br />3) With the main Angel Food Cake, measure inside with tooth picks as markers 1.25 inches so you have a border on the edges all around; if you have something thin and flat (this is a tricky part; unless you've done this before with Bundt cakes) - for example: skewers (for k'bobs), another really ultra thin knife, or something where you have a starting point - measure it 2 inches from the top (which will be on a plate to a Lazy Susan - whichever you have it set on). You will also need a bowl. First cut the inside in an "X" motion until you hit that object then stop and start the other side then work your way around. You will then be able to remove everything out from inside of the cake except that small remnant that remains in bottom which can be removed carefully with a melon ball scooper, small cup, spoon - (examples).<br />Reserve 1/4th of the Angel Food in one bowl and cover it tightly, and reserve another 1/2 of the Angel Food which has been crumbled into pieces wrapped tightly or placed in Tupperware or Rubbermaid bowl which has been drowned with a bottle of Fudge and place in refrigerator. The remainder, everyone can eat it unless you wish to save some for decorations on cake (like a tombstone and graveyard - put those aside)- you can form these remnants by squeezing them together and making creations out of it before they have been icing or decorated.<br /><br />4)Place the base bottom on top of the hallow (which is upside down) and cover it; carefully setting it aside with a lid.<br /><br />5) For the ooey, gooey, smo'ooey inside - find instant Mooooooooooosseeee mix, buy at least three boxes to be on the safe side - take your pick; orange, yellow, green, or black (fudge) - if you want to layer it in multiple colors - you can; this what makes it all the fun!<br /><br />a) You can snatch the Peeps Ghosts and stuff them on the top and layer the first part with green (Pistacho)Mooooooooooosssssseyyyyy, then with the crumbly fudgey-wudey Angel Food as the spacer - spread it all around, then the next layer can be a simple Jell-O Wigglers (??) ... it's all up to your imagination as you fill up that Angel Food Cake but just remember to refrigerate it upside down first and permit it to rest before proceeding to the next level. To make life interesting - I love to do this, the same thing what they use to freeze bananas with as well as Ice Cream - I use that for the bottom end of the Angel Food as well as to Attach the Base Bottom to the Main Cake and it gets Frozen and yes, sometimes there are eyeballs in the cake but where?  I don't know that's what makes it so gross and interesting as well as fun!<br /><br />5) Whether you use Marzepan to Icing after you remove the Angel Food Cake out of the freezer to begin decorating it is solely your preference but keep in mind this has to remain refrigerated but before you serve it, please allow it to stand at least 15 to 20 minutes before the "FUN STARTS" ... expect a mess ... after all, where's all the fun without the "gore"?<br /><br />:-D<br /><br />I've used it for Adult Entertainment to my own son's parties to my grandchildrens ... every time it's always something different!<br /><br />PS: If you are using this for "Adult Entertainment" (no children) - and you have access to "Dry Ice" - you can use a special Sealed canister that will give an eerie appearance that this cake is smoking if you are using the Halloween Lights and so forth. Not only will you receive a lot of compliments .... it is really, really good - You will be a big hit, not only will the cake be so pretty to eat, but just perfect for the show... trust me, it is worth all the mess ... just watch your guests scrape it all up and some even licking their own PLATES! LOL! LOL! LOL!!!! (Yes, they do go back for more if there's anymore; and I've seen disappointed guests when they return back and only to find out all the Cakes are gone, in addition, I've even been asked if I had anymore so they could take some home for their kids? I admit, I do feel a little bad but it is a lot of work but worth every bit of it - take my word!)<br /><br />This year's theme is 'THE EYES HAVE IT' ...  :-D  I have some other eyeballs, but this is the MAIN ATTRACTION ... YEAH!<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />But of course you didn't read this review from me otherwise everyone else will begin doing this.<br /><br />:P
