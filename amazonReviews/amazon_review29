This is a long message. I apologize for its length. I would like to communicate my experience with Zola Acai Blueberry. I started drinking it, and the other two drinks in this series, Zola Acai Plain and Zola Acai Pineapple, several months ago, before they switched over to their new processing and bottling procedures. I tried all three drinks, and eventually became addicted to Zola Acai Blueberry. When they switched over to their new methods, I was at first disappointed, because I was used to the old taste and composition, but the contents were exactly the same, and I quickly became addicted to the new. It's by far my favorite drink, and I have to stop myself from drinking more than 3 bottles each day.<br /><br />All that is fine, but it's not the real story. The real story is that it changed my life, because for at least the 8 years previous to that I had suffered from life-crushing migraines. I was a classic migraine sufferer, with perhaps two major migraines each month that completely incapacitated me for 20 hours each time once they began. During that time I could do no more than sit up and fast with my back against the wall and legs raised up to bed height, in total darkness, with no noise, and in excruciating pain. It was impossible to do anything but sit there in total darkness and silence for 20 hours, trying to doze off as much as possible to escape the pain, and just watching the clock frantically waiting for the expected 20 hours to end my misery. I could not lie down on the bed, because that made the pain even worse.<br /><br />In between these major bouts of horror, I had numerous smaller migraines of various sizes. On most days I had migraines. Sometimes they forced me to lie in total darkness and silence for hours, sometimes they permitted me to work, read, or watch TV, but I was almost never free of headache for more than one or two days per week. On most nights I went to bed sitting up, to minimize the pain.<br /><br />When I started drinking Zola Acai, I noticed within a week that my migraine condition had suddenly improved a lot. As more days went by, it became increasingly undeniable that this was no random fluctuation. When a couple of rainy days came and I had no migraine, I knew that something really remarkable had happened. At that point I began a serious analytical effort trying to discover what was the cause of the sudden relief I was now experiencing.<br /><br />After some two to three weeks I had eliminated everything but the Zola Acai, of which, at that time, I was drinking perhaps 3 or 4 bottles per week. I searched on Google for some indication that acai could help a migraine, but ultimately found insufficient to my satisfaction. Meanwhile<br />I kept increasing my intake, and the more I did, the more relief I got. I also began checking on the other ingredients of the same drink. I took a hard look at the 24 mg of guarana berry (natural caffeine) that is in each bottle. When I checked on Google I found a number of entries pointing to guarana as helpful for migraine.<br /><br />Gradually, I became convinced that it wasn't the acai at all that was giving me the relief, but the guarana. At that point, I purchased a large bottle of guarana tablets from sourcenaturals.com (or more specifically, from the Life Extension foundation, which purchased them from sourcenaturals). Each tablet has 200 mg of guarana caffeine in it. I cut each in half, and began taking half a guarana tablet each day (the dosage on the bottle recommends 3 full tablets, 600 mg, for "energy" each day, and says not a word about migraine).<br /><br />I have continued drinking the Zola Acai, so I get about 150 to 175 mg of guarana caffeine per day in all. I rarely drink coffee, and seldom even tea. This regimen has all but removed migraines from my life. I have recommended Zola and guarana tablets enthusiastically to many people, but most people I know don't have migraines, and I am not sure that anyone has ever taken me up on it so far, so I don't know the results. When I can no longer afford Zola, I have reason to believe I will be fine on the guarana tablets alone, although I expect that I will probably have to up the intake each day to a full tablet (200 mg). Meanwhile, I keep drinking the Zola Acai Blueberry because I love it. I've tried other acai drinks, but they don't even begin to match up for me in taste and satisfaction.<br /><br />It's necessary to emphasize that my experience is totally anecdotal, that of one man, me. I know of no scientifically controlled studies to confirm what I'm saying. As far as I am aware, there aren't any, at least not yet. For perhaps 2 years prior to that I tried feverfew, which has given partial relief to some subjects in controlled studies, but I could not claim any relief from it, and finally just gave it up. Over-the-counter headache drugs, which have given some relief at times to others, just made my migraines worse.<br /><br />I no longer get the life-crushing migraines that plagued my life for years. I have gotten some two or three migraines during the last 6 months, evidently due to extreme insufficient sleep 2 to 3 nights in a row. These attacks lasted up to 20 hours each, but were not enough to stop me from writing, reading, going on the Internet, and watching videos. For someone used to real migraines, these were far from serious.<br /><br />Please spread this message as much as you can. I do not know how many it will help or not help, but it recounts an experience that has literally changed my life. Please include the whole message, if possible, and point out that this experience is as yet entirely anecdotal, so I have no idea how many people it might help and how many not. Migraines can come from entirely different sources, and there is little doubt that there are many migraine sufferers whom it not help at all. But the change was so sudden, dramatic, and emphatic in my own life, that it's hard not to expect that there will be others who will find a comparable relief.<br /><br />By the way, the price on Amazon is unexpectedly low. The cheapest I have found in New York City is $2.49/bottle at this time, minus 10% for an order over $150.00. That was at Whole Foods. Amazon's price is even lower, especially on small orders, and the best I have seen.<br /><br />I have no relation at this time other than as a customer to Amazon.com, Source Naturals,  Life Extension Foundation, or Zola, Inc.<br /><br />Eugene
