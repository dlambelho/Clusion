Tested on RUGER, 11 year old male neutered beagle type dog, 17 inches high and 25 pounds. Moderate activity level.<br />Slightly crazy, very lovable, goofy disposition, quite the momma's boy.<br /><br />Over a week I offered this food to my dog along side a bowl of his regular diet. His regular diet is Purina D/H mixed Loyall Lamb and Rice kibble.<br />He is a pretty predictable dog, and every day he chose to eat his D/H chunks out first, then a few kibbles of the Loyall, than he would eat a few bites of the Chef Michaels.<br />So, he did like it, and he did eat it.<br />There were a few things that drew my attention.<br />1. No where on the bag does it say where the ingredients are sourced. Is he eating American beef? Mexico?<br />Now, it doesn't say where his food is sourced on his D/H (Purina Dental Health) BUT, he loves that food SO MUCH and it keeps his teeth so nice I do continue to feed it to him. After all, I can't source where all the ingredients I EAT come from, so why should my dog eat better than I do? So, it isn't a major issue, but for those who really want to know, well, you will have to contact Purina.<br />2. The food felt FLUFFY and a bit greasy, and the red dyed beefy bits drifted with handling to the top. So, you have to shake before serving to get the kibbles to mix in a more uniform way before feeding. Otherwise, your dog gets a bowl of soft beefy bits and no kibble.<br />3. The kibble pieces did not seem crunchy enough to prevent tartar build up. Hummm. Perhaps after a long feeding diet of this your pet will NEED Purina D/H. I may be on to something here. I doubt this diet will do anything for dental health for your dog.<br />4. Why add artificial colors? Really? He doesn't even look at the food. At 11 years old, His sight may be questionable anyway and as a BEAGLE he doesn't look in the bowl before eating. He sniffs everything. To my dog, smell is everything. And for most dogs, I've never seen them eye each piece of kibble before chowing down. I seriously doubt dogs care if the potato bits are brown, the green bean kibbles are green, or the meat is red. Actually, after cooking, it should be brown as well. The colors can be left out, they are unnecessary. BUT, then again, as a kid who grew up on Kool-Aid, Mom enjoyed mixing up all those great colorful drinks for us, and we grew up fine (twitch twitch) but I state again, no sense in my dog eating better than me. (Now I want some red fruity punch just writing this)<br />5. Serving size is WAY too much. Each cup of this food has 270 calories. THAT IS A LOT! 28% protein and 16% fat. That is a bit more protein and fat than my guy is used to, so, it may be a bit "rich" for some dogs. ALSO, take notice, not all that protein is from those dried beefy looking chewy chunks. There are other sources of proteins in here, from Chicken by product meal, corn gluten, and soy. These are all sources of protein, but it may seem misleading if you think the protein is all from beef (which is, by the way, the number one ingredient)<br />6. The fat is "animal fat" so your guess is as good as mine. Emu? Llama? Pig? Sheep? Deer? Bison? Snake? Who knows, they should just label it "mystery fat" and I hope soylent green is not some of the green bits.<br /><br />I know, it sounds like I am knocking the food, and I really am not. It is DOG FOOD. My dog goes outside and eats rabbit poo, so I feel this bag of food is at least more nutritionally complete than rabbit poo.<br />And again, some of our human foods aren't much better, so I don't feel guilty feeding this to my dog while I enjoy a cool glass of Kool-Aid and chow down on some McDonald's Fries-- OCCASIONALLY.<br />In a perfect world, we would all eat nuts and berries, and fresh protein sources. If you want to feed your dog dog food you are pretty limited on types and styles. This is the junk food style dog food. I would give it occasionally as a treat (as I also do everything in moderation, I am not eating fries and KoolAid daily)<br />But I don't think I could feed this in good conscience to my dog daily, unless I added some FRESH raw meat and some pureed veggies, and probably I'd have to add something crunchy for dental health.<br /><br />This diet would probably be good for dog with rotten teeth already who find it too painful to eat regular foods and whose owners would rather put them on this instead of looking into their mouth problem.<br />Also, it would be good for picky eaters, whose owners would rather feed them this than find out why their dog's appetite is lacking.<br />This diet would also be good for training, you can take the bits out and use them as training treats. But take a rag, they leave a residue on your hands.
