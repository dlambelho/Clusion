***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW">Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn't realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted "real" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn't even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap.
