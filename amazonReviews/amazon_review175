I was all excited to get these Planters Big Triple Nut Bars because the photo on the box looks like crispy peanut brittle studded with giant almonds and cashews. Even better, there's my good friend Mr. Peanut tipping his top hat with one white-gloved hand, holding his cane at a jaunty angle in the other. He's got such a big grin on his face, I know he's winking at me from behind that monocle! Yes, the box says "chewy granola bars", but I thought that would mean that they are both delicious AND healthy.<br /><br />Wrong! Mr. Peanut, how could you do this to me?<br /><br />First of all, the packaging is very deceptive. The box could hold 10 or 11 bars instead of 5. Yes, it's more than twice the volume of the product it holds and that is deceptive. The photo of the bar itself is enlarged approximately 100% so maybe that was the excuse. In reality, the bars are very small, weighing a tad over 1 1/2 ounces each and measuring about 1 1/4 inches wide by 4 3/4 inches long by 5/8 of an inch thick.<br /><br />The smell is okay, like roasted peanuts, pretty much what you would expect.<br /><br />But what about the taste?<br /><br />The flavor is pretty much one note, peanuts. That's the only thing I could taste. Normally, that would be a good thing because I love peanuts! Unfortunately, the peanuts taste stale and have an unpleasant aftertaste. The bars are also way too sweet and much too salty. (I had to brush my teeth and use mouthwash both to get rid of the taste.)<br /><br />I couldn't see any cashews or almonds in the bar at all. I did finally find one and a half very small almonds buried inside as I broke off each bite looking for the nuts. I couldn't identify any cashews by sight or by taste and I could identify the almonds only by sight and by the slight crunch, no almond flavor either.<br /><br />The texture (other than the tiny crunch from the almonds) is like soft peanuts mixed with cornmeal and coated in sticky soft goo. I really didn't enjoy the texture at all, it just didn't feel good on my teeth when biting down.<br /><br />I'm not surprised I couldn't tell the cashews from the peanuts but I couldn't even tell the oats from the peanuts by texture or taste and barely by sight because of the sticky goo.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't know what was worse, the soft sticky texture or the cheap bitter peanut taste or the overwhelming sweetness or the heavy saltiness.<br /><br />Actually, I do know what is worse than all of that: the ingredient list and nutrition information. The box touts the 7 grams of protein but neglects to highlight the 12 grams of fat and 23 grams of carbohydrates. (An ounce is a little over 28 grams so that's quite a bit of fat and sugar.)<br /><br />The one good thing I see is a lot of vitamin E because of the tocopherols added as a flavor preservative.<br /><br />Other things that bother me are that the crisped rice is rice flour, sweeteners are listed eight times, and almonds and cashews are listed just before the under-1.5% ingredients. Since peanuts aren't really nuts (they're legumes), I think putting "Big Nut Bars" and "Triple Nut" on the package is very deceptive given the scarcity of the cashews and almonds and calling them granola bars is a bit of a stretch as well.<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />Peanuts<br />Corn syrup<br />Crisped rice (rice flour, sugar, malt extract, salt, caramel color, mixed tocopherols)<br />Peanut butter (roasted ground peanuts)<br />Sugar<br />Evaporated cane juice invert syrup<br />Whole grain rolled oats<br />Almonds<br />Cashews<br /><br />Contains less than 1.5% of:<br /><br />Whey (from milk)<br />Soy lecithin<br />Salt<br />Honey<br />Vegetable oil (peanut and/or cottonseed oil)<br />Resistant corn dextrin<br />Granola (whole grain rolled oats, brown sugar, whole grain wheat, coconut, canola oil, wheat bran)<br />Xanthan gum<br />Mixed tocopherols<br /><br />Nutrition Information:<br /><br />Serving size one bar (46g or 1.62 oz)<br />Calories 220<br />Calories from Fat 100<br />Total fat 12g (18% of daily value)<br />Saturated fat 1.5g (8% of daily value)<br />Trans fat 0g<br />Polyunsaturated fat 3.5g<br />Monounsaturated fat 6g<br />Cholesterol 0%<br />Sodium 230mg 10%<br />Total carbohydrates 23g 8%<br />Dietary fiber 3g 12%<br />Sugars 13g<br />Protein 7g 7%<br />Vitamin A 0%<br />Vitamin C 0%<br />Calcium 2%<br />Iron 6%<br />Vitamin E 110%<br />Phosphorus 10%<br /><br />It may seem silly to give such a long review of these candy bars but I really felt let down by Planters, Kraft, and especially Mr. Peanut. I know these aren't gourmet brands but my experience is that they have consistently decent quality. It really seems like this product was just an excuse to use up low-quality and leftover ingredients by creating a sweet, salty snack food to make people fat and give them diabetes and cavities. Offhand, I can't think of a less enjoyable way to eat 220 calories especially when almost half of them are from fat.<br /><br />I'm sorry, Mr. Peanut, but I think it is kinder to be honest with you because we've been friends for such a long time. I would want you to tell me if I didn't taste good to you, either!
