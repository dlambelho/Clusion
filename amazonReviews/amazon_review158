Last year, I purchased a Keurig machine.  K-cups are extremely convenient and cleanup is so easy.  So many varieties of coffee to choose from and they are generally pretty good.  I've tried a number of K-cups since last year and reviewed a few here.  Fast forward to almost a year later.  My Keurig machine started to act up and I called customer service.  It started short cupping me and would automatically shut off.  It's hit or miss for when I brew a cup of coffee now.  Customer service had me try a number of things and finally decided to replace my Keurig machine.  I am waiting for the new one to arrive.  (I'm getting to the Starbucks review...wait for it.)  I decided to go buy a back of beans, as I had always done previous to purchasing a Keurig.  Also, I purchased a $14 Mr Coffee 5-cup drip coffeemaker.<br /><br />I ground up the beans, put it into my newly cleaned new coffeemaker, and made some Starbucks.  It smelled fantastic.  I remembered that smell.  Nothing like fresh brewed coffee smell.  I started to drink a cup.  It was good solid cup of Starbucks coffee(which is a bit strong anyway I think).  It got me thinking.  I decided to do a taste test of K-cup vs Starbucks.  I popped in the best K-cup I had around, a Timothy's Columbian.  I compared the two.  The Starbucks had depth to it.  Multidimensional compared to the K-cup, which I had thought was a great K-cup until now.  The K-cup had only one dimension of taste to it(some nuttiness) and did not fill out with the floral notes like the fresh ground.  The body of the Starbucks coffee was much fuller, too.  I was really amazed at the difference between the two.  I noticed that the Timothy's was smooth, only hit the front part of the tongue with taste, and did not linger long with a finish.  The Starbucks seemed to hit the entire tongue with taste and the finish lasted quite a bit longer.  In other words, with the Starbucks you know you have had a cup of coffee and it satisfied well.<br /><br />Where does this leave me?  I am seriously considering going back to whole beans and grinding them up daily now.  I love the convenience and clean-up of the Keurig but I have been missing out on taste.  There are many excellent beans to try. Here is a list of pros and cons of each...<br /><br />Whole Bean:<br />PRO<br />- Great taste, multidimensional.<br />- Significantly lower cost compared to K-cup(cheapest I can get is 35 cents per cup.  fresh ground is nearly 13 cents)<br />- Huge variety<br />- Can get 100% Kona or Blue Mountain<br />- Low cost coffeemaker can be used.<br />- Coffeemaker has few parts to go wrong and is easy to clean<br />- Small footprint on counter top for a coffeemaker.<br />- Many styles and colors to choose from.<br />- Fresh taste.<br /><br />CON<br />- Takes more time.  (time to clean the coffeemaker, time to grind the beans, time to brew the coffee)<br />- Not a lot of great 4-5 cup coffeemakers out there.<br />- Not as easy to grind up beans for one cup of coffee. I found it takes a lot of tapping out of my small grinder for 2 tbls.<br /><br />K-Cup:<br />PRO<br />-  Fast coffeemaker.<br />-  Extremely convenient when wanting to make just one cup of coffee.<br />-  Huge variety of K-cups available.<br />-  Extremely easy cleanup with just a damp paper towel.<br />-  Coffee isn't stale tasting like already ground coffee you purchase in the store.  Once you open a can of regular ground<br />  coffee, the first brew or two is fine but after that it turns stale very rapidly.  The freshness is due to the nitrogen<br />  gas in each K-cup.  Each one will stay fairly fresh.<br />-  Relatively quiet compared to the Mr Coffee 5-cup coffeemaker I purchased.  It still has some noise but not much.<br />-  K-cup coffee isn't bad at all.<br />-  My K-cup is available.  You can add your own fresh ground beans and make a cup in the Keurig.  That decreases some of<br />  the convenience but many love it.  (101 reviewers out of 500 or so give this a 1 star rating...mostly saying it delivers<br />  a weak cup of coffee.)<br /><br />CON<br />-  Expensive coffeemaker.<br />-  Track record of issues with short cupping and automatic shutoffs.<br />-  Inability to fully empty the coffeemaker.  It concerns me that water is in it all the time and could lead to mold.<br />-  Environmental issues with K-cups.  There's a lot of plastic waste with a K-cup.<br />-  Not as fresh tasting as the fresh ground beans.<br />-  Lacks that smell of fresh brewed coffee in the air.<br />-  One dimensional flavor compared to whole bean fresh brewed.<br />-  Takes up a lot of counter space.  It's a huge honkin' machine.<br />-  Only comes in black unless you get the mini(which the no reservoir and has issues with temperature).<br />-  Bold varieties often push coffee grounds back up into the 3 holes from the pump. Hit or miss with this one.<br />  Bold varieties have about 30% more coffee in each K-Cup and are sometimes really packed.<br />-  Only a few mediocre Kona blends are available in a K-cup.  They don't have 100% Kona or Blue Mountain.  Tully's<br />  isn't too bad.<br /><br />Maybe I have a place for both coffeemakers.  Maybe I will take the Keurig to work and savor fresh beans at home.
