The scent of freshly steeped Superfruit White Mangosteen with Peach tea... reminds me of my voyages...<br /><br />It was hot.  The air was thick.  It hung.  It began to rain.  The H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish rolled ever so slight.  The scud's indicated squally weather.  Such was life on the seas around the Dutch East Indies in the Spring of 1931.  There was no escaping it.  The fear to be lost to Davey Jones locker was never more present.<br /><br />"Make no mistake gentleman!", I yelled at my crew, "The seas are an ugly today my friends, but Her Majesty will carry the day!".  "Man the rigging!  First Mate Tignor, hold the line!!!"  "Aye, skipper", First Mate Tignor sung.  My crew was steady, but they were tired.  It had been a long and perilous journey around the Cape of Good Hope.  Rations were meager, but morale was high.  Our journey was epic.<br /><br />Beneath deck I sighed to Boson's Mate Micklegal, "Curses that scoundrel Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford!  There is much of us he asks, but for he does not know the dangerous chain of events for which he has set to motion."  Truth be told, traveling through the Dutch East Indies always left me uneasy.  Boson's Mate Micklegal sensed this.<br /><br />"Captain, the line is steady, our bearings are true.  She's tip top Captain.  The Western winds will carry us.  Do not lose faith, Captain.", said Boson's Mate Micklegal.  A cheery fellow, Boson's Mate Micklegal was.  He threw the kettle of Earl Grey onto the flame.  "Cup of Earl Grey, Captain?", he asked.  He always knew how to raise morale.  Boson's Mate Micklegal, as any fine Englishman, knows that Earl Grey is the finest tea in all the Empire, and as is known, that "The Earl", is the tea of Kings.  "I'm going to check on the boys", he said, and he vanished up top.<br /><br />So why did the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish find herself in the middle of this confusing and dense achieapalgo?  Her Majesty, Queen Victoria.  You see, Her Majesty, Queen Victoria, offered 100 pounds to anyone who could return the sacred Purple Mangosteen to her fresh and free of tropical disease.  So we sought to follow in the footsteps of James Herbert Veitch who said of his journey's to this foreign land that, "to eat the Mangosteen it is necessary to eat the Mangosteen grown within three or four degrees of latitude of the equator to realize at all the attractive and curious properties of this fruit."  Alas, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford set orders, and when Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford set orders, the crew H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish obeyed. But the journey would not be simple.  Before us and the Mangosteen stood Privateer infested Dutch waters, malaria infested jungles, and the legendary humanoid beast, the "java man".<br /><br />We knew the legendary Dutch privateer, Jan Janszoon was somewhere within these waters.  Our goal was simple, to reach the Spice Islands, retrieve the Purple Mangosteen, return it to Queen Victoria, and enjoy the splendor of our bounty.  First Mate Tignor had used the celestial heavens to plot our course directly to the Maluku Islands, home of the Tropical Evergreen Tree bearing said Mangosteen.  I clenched onto the port deck, and dug in.<br /><br />First Mate Tignor anchored the H.M.S. Peregrine Caverdish in the shallows a hundred meters from the sandy shore.  First Mate Tignor, Boson's Mate Micklegal, Midshipman Householder and myself boarded the longboat and approached the shore.  We traveled through 6 kilometers of malaria infested jungles.  The boys were tense at the thought of encounter with the "java man".  As we pushed out way close to the Mangosteen Tree, we sensed that we were not alone.<br /><br />Then from out of nowhere, jumped out the wretched beast, a humanoid creature, with distinct ancient features, as if time forgot this creature.  The Java Man appeared similar to Caveman exhibits I remembered from my youth visits at the Natural History Museum on Exhibition Road, South Kensington, London, England, as a young lad.  As we recoiled in horror, Boson's Mate Micklegal, ever the young ing&eacute;nue, picked up a stone, and with all his might, slung it at the Java Man, striking him square in the head.  With a forceful grunt, the Java Man collapsed at the foot of the Mangosteen tree.  "If the Java Man were as true and gentlemanly as an Englishman, he would be called the Tea Man", Boson's Mate Micklegal stated with a chuckle, ever the subtle humourist.<br /><br />Back at the boat, Boson's Mate Micklegal added the zest of the Mangosteen, along with peaches that remained from our previous summer's voyage to Zanzibar to the loose tea leaves, and four minutes later, we had a delicious concoction that tasted of pure victory.  Like any victory, this was cause for celebration.  Boson's Mate Micklegal pulled out a bottle of Glen Fiddyich he had stowed away in the hold, and we all celebrated our victory.<br /><br />However, Boson's Mate Micklegal, ever the fan of a fine scotch, and often victim of such devlish vices, filled his belly with too much scotch.  At some point, in his sloshed bender, Boson's Mate Micklegal ate all the Mangosteen.  The ultimate irony being that despite our victory, there would be no bounty from Queen Victoria.<br /><br />I do believe that was a difficult time, and it was a scar we all carried until the hacks at Lipton discovered Superfruit White Mangosteen with Peach tea.  Truly, a unique flavor as harrowing as it's conception.
