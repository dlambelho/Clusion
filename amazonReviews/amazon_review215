I started with the 1/2 tspn serving on the label for Just Like Sugar, and went up to about 10 times for sweet coffee.<br /><br />I drink coffee black most of the time, but when I use sweetener I expect it to be sweet with a reasonable amount in accordance with the serving size on the label.  This was not the case with Just Like Sugar (JLS).<br /><br />Based on my experience, which seems to be in accordance with some other reviewers here, instead of "330 servings" as listed on the 5.82 oz container, if you drink only one 6 oz cup of coffee a day, this product will last you anywhere from two weeks to a month and you will get 15-33 servings, if that is all you use it for.  I drink a small pot of coffee (5 cups) a day, so if I sweetened every cup, it would last me 3 - 6 days.  Fortunately I don't drink sweet coffee that often so I won't have to pay an extra $30 a month just for sweetener.<br /><br />Cost:  By Amazon's pricing, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002714IUI">N'JOY Pure Cane Sugar - 8/22 oz. Canisters</a> is .12 cents per ounce, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> is $5.37 per ounce, and JLS is $1.80 per ounce (note that the $1.40 per ounce listed at this time by Amazon is also inaccurate) for the 5.82 oz container listed here at $10.49, however, the Stevia differs in strength.  Pure stevia extract is up to 300 times sweeter than sugar, and a 3.5 oz container contains 2381 servings.  JLS claims it is just as sweet as sugar, so by this statement you are paying more than ten times the amount of money you would for plain sugar.  Going by a .5 gram serving (as listed on the JLS label) and dividing each ounce by 56 (for .5 grams in each ounce), sugar is .002 cents per .5 g serving while JLS is .03 cents, and Pure Stevia Extract (PSE) is .008 cents per serving ($18.81 for 3.5 oz divided by 2381 servings).  Not only is this product almost 4 times more expensive than PSE, but the stevia extract is more potent per serving, and actually does sweeten an entire cup of coffee with just one serving.  Judging by the sweetness, you could probably go with just a half serving of stevia vice 10 times or more the recommended serving of JLS.  By this measure, JLS could be up to 80 times more expensive than stevia.<br /><br />I was introduced to this product in reading Dr. Blaylock's Wellness report, which I find helpful most of the time.  He says it is his favorite, so he may be simply enamored with a product that has no real proven adverse side effects and can be used as an alternative to sugar, which has many.  For those who happen to be Jewish, the product is apparently kosher, as the label also has the stamp of approval from the Chief Rabbinate of Israel.<br /><br />Taking the recommended 1/4 teaspoon serving straight, JLS is light and fluffy, with a very slight crunchiness until it dissolves into a sticky texture.  There is little aftertaste, and it is relatively close enough to sugar to serve as an alternative, if you just ate sugar and didn't care about texture.  I have not found a sweetener yet that actually tastes the same as sugar, and even if it did, it probably would not have the same effects as scientific studies have shown sugar to have (opiate like).<br /><br />Conclusion:  While Just Like Sugar is probably better for your health than sugar, I believe Pure Stevia Extract is even better and may cost up to 80 times less per serving than JLS.  Of course, the healthiest option would be not using any sweetener whatsoever, but since you are here on a sweetener page, I recommend the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VRSR84">Pure Stevia Extract Powder by Kal - 3.5 oz</a> (PSEP) from Kal instead of this product.  Just remember, it is 300 times sweeter than sugar, so you don't have to use nearly as much.  There can be an aftertaste with stevia, but using the correct amount helps tremendously, and the aftertaste is sweet, not acrid.  The Kal PSEP product comes with a very tiny scoop, which I found more than enough (I could probably go with half that) to sweeten a full 9 oz mug of coffee.  Also, be sure to get "pure" stevia extract and verify that is the only ingredient on the nutrition label, as many other "stevia" products have fillers and chemically derived components of stevia.  Sweetleaf seems okay (I haven't tried it yet), as it's only other ingredient is inulin soluble fiber, which may be conducive to health, but it is much more expensive and much less potent.  Watch out for products like Truvia, which contains Erythritol (a sugar alcohol) as the main ingredient, rebiana (synthetically derived with chemical processes from stevia), and other "natural flavors" which can be just as bad, or even worse than some artifical flavoring (same chemicals, but can be unnaturally processed from natural sources).
