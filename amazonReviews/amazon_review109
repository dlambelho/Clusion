OK, so I'm used to drinking (and have a preference for) the cans that have the aluminum top you peel back--it's a teeny tiny frustration to have to, well, clean the inevitably dusty, traveled top of any can, whether with a damp towel, rinsing, or my shirt if I'm not feeling particularly energetic.<br /><br />That said, the price through Amazon (at $2 higher than The Chef's Warehouse that charges $9.95 for shipping) is much better, and this is JUST the kind of thing that, while it's pretty near-identical the price of my local grocer, I appreciate not hauling far.<br /><br />Now about the soda... I'm NOT a soda drinker. I abhor that corn syrupy colored mess called cola (though Cheerwine keeps a spot in my less than three!)... in general, my stomach, as I sort of banned this drink category for 360+ days a year at the age of 13, gets very upset when carbonated water is put in it, especially with caffeine in most carbonated things... and another interesting tummy woe is orange juice. Unless it's fresh squeezed and "normal" orange juice (not the awesomely rich Florida kinds of oranges), well, I'm sorta not able to handle that, not even after prilosec entered my world.<br /><br />Now for the confusion. This stuff... it tastes amazingly fresh, the carbonation isn't excessive, with 18% juice, I get some natural vitamin C (pills are no good anyway, not for 99 thousand out of 99,001 people), and I'm not drinking pure buzzed OJ. I am also not getting mouth sores or anything of the sort that I recall getting when OJ was one of those everyday 12 ounces of it items... yeah, I wasn't terribly smart, but then again, metabolism of a hummingbird forgives just about all food habits... I'm older, wiser (don't use semicid), and this is that mature drink for me...<br /><br />I think it is perfect for people who, like me, can't do straight OJ, who can't quite bring themselves to inhale pure sugar/corn syrup sodas, who don't want their drinks tasting like food coloring, you get the picture... it just tastes like a fresh citrus spritzer, like the bubbling of champagne with the juice content of a margarita and no alcohol. If you like tonic water, this could replace that kind of unhealthy addictive drink (for your eyes in particular, as quinine leads to blindness when used for more than a couple months). If you like margaritas or screwdrivers or want some fizz without it being fake Fanta fizzle, then this is what to drink.<br /><br />It isn't particularly surprising (to me) that this happens to be my run-to drink when I'm eating cheesy Italian foods... it seriously was made FOR rich Italian dishes (seafood, I'm not so sure on--I think vino would be better for fish dishes)... plate me up something with creams, cheeses, maybe prosciutto and butter sauces, etc... and this somehow feels like its bubbling acid is helping my stomach along--maybe just because the most healthy of adult tummies still (well, when the diet has gone adult and is less saturated with fats, less gooey, less fried, less American in general) have some trouble digesting cheese on cheese on gooey awesome cheese with some roasted-in-olive-oil veggies, of course, and the occasional land mammal commonly consumed in Italy.<br /><br />My point? If you're eating pizza, calzone, lasagna, or even other Euro-derived foods... or if you're eating some fried chicken, even, this drink is an amazing counterpart. If you take anything like proton pump inhibitors regularly (prilosec, aciphex, etc., or even zantac types of meds), then this could be that perfect add-on when you go off your healthy food diet and splurge for something you know might irritate. No, I'm not selling it as a medicine, though mmm this DOES remind me of when cola used to be good stuff (when it was just a bit of sugar and when real cherries were in the cup) and why they decided to put some things in such syrups to deliver more effectively... it's darn good stuff. It's NOT your everyday soda. To my knowledge, they are adamant against using corn syrup, and having had the stuff in blue, in pale blue/yellow, and in a couple other cans, also having had it in glass bottles (panna is also made by them, so you can imagine the quality of the water that goes into this drink!)... well, it's all been some water, some OJ, some sugar (but not a lot), some natural CO2, and ... maybe natural flavor? Hmm, would have to get off my currenly lazy rump (with a currently terrible signal to post this review) and check... but I do indulge in this one soda here and there, despite "knowing better" from years in med school and more years teaching integrated nutritional sciences alongside medicine (to try targeting the source of so many health woes, we really DO have to check in on our diets!)...<br /><br />As long as it stays caffeine free and low on the carbonation (which is reckless and artificial in US sodas--really disgusting and rather harmful)... then I'll drink this... not daily, but maybe go through a 6 pack or 2 in a month, depending on just how often I do splurge on foods that my stomach feels just a bit... weighted down by... and I can even drink it on an empty stomach, meaning the carbonation is seriously low compared to our crazy sodas and "energy" drinks.<br /><br />Mmm, I think my lazy rump might need a bit of sizzling refreshment in the form of aranciata san pellegrino... the healthiest soda I've found SO FAR that still keeps its cost around a buck with tax.
