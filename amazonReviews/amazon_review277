This new line of jelly beans by David Klein, the creator of Jelly Belly jelly beans, is made with 100% natural flavors and colors. That will be great news to those with allergies to food colorants as well as to those who prefer to keep the amount of chemicals in their snacks to a minimum.  In addition to this "taste of everything" sampler, the beans are sold in several different mixes (like the 5-alarm spicy Man Mix or the fruity Soda Fountain Mix) as well as individually, so you can really create the bean collection that works for you!<br /><br />This sampler includes 16 flavors. Among people I know who have tasted these beans, there is a great divide in likes and dislikes--some that I hated, others loved and vice versa. Every person is different, so just because I hated something doesn't mean you will.  That said, following are my personal impressions on each flavor in the sampler:<br /><br />*****My Favorites--Could eat them again and again (and already have!).<br /><br />Grape: Tastes like Nehi grape soda from my childhood, sweet but delicious.<br /><br />Strawberry:  Bright, sweet flavor with a nice finish. Reminiscent of strawberry preserves.<br /><br />Root Beer:  Sweet and tangy, addictive and satisfying. Maybe my #1 fave.<br /><br />Pomegranate: Sweet and tangy, but in a totally different way than root beer. Yum!<br /><br />Cranberry:  Sweet and tart; like dried cranberries vs. fresh.<br /><br />Orange Punch: DELISH! Very sweet, bright flavor. Can almost taste the carbonation as if it was orange soda vs. orange punch.<br /><br />****My Liked-but-not-Loved List--Enjoyed, but don't crave them like the faves.<br /><br />Coconut: Very distinct, spot-on flavor, but pretty strong. Best in combination with other beans. Not something I could eat again and again by itself.<br /><br />Vanilla bean: Same reaction as coconut. Good in combo, not in volume alone.<br /><br />Green apple: Could have been more tart.  Tasty but a bit bland.<br /><br />Peach: Quite intense. More like peach nectar than a fresh peach. Didn't love the finish.<br /><br />Lemon: Expected it to be a fave, but it wasn't. It has the tartness of a fresh lemon, but would have preferred a sweeter taste, as was done with grape and orange (like lemonade).<br /><br />Black Cherry: Also expected to be a fave, but wasn't. I am liking it more and more as I try it, though. Better alone than combined with other flavors and better with 2 or more of the same flavor at once. Wish it had a deeper flavor.<br /><br />Blueberry:  I liked the inside but didn't care as much for the shell. Tastes more like a blueberry muffin than a fresh blueberry, but that is a good thing in my eyes. :)<br /><br />Ginger:  Powerful! Very spicy, like biting into fresh ginger. The flavor is beautifully reproduced, but was a bit overpowering for me to want to eat many.<br /><br />**Least Favorites--Flavors I have no desire to eat again.<br /><br />Bacon: Man, I WANTED to love this! I love bacon! But I didn't love this bean.  I didn't even like it.  It tastes more like Liquid Smoke than bacon. Yuck. Don't suggest you mix it with any of the sweeter beans.<br /><br />Himalayan sea salt:  Strange/alien on the tongue at first, but kind of interesting while chewing. This one was originally on my Liked-but-don't-Love List, but then I realized I had no desire to ever eat another one. Also tastes worse when eaten with other beans, esp. the sweeter ones.<br /><br />I wish there had been more mixable flavors in the sampler, like back in the days when Jelly Bellies were new and my colleagues and I were always thinking of new pairings to make delicious flavor combinations.  I did some combining in this sampler.  Can't say there was anything that really stood out as a great combo, though I would say if you don't like super sweet, you may want to eat the super sweet ones with something with a little tartness like the cranberry, pomegranate or lemon beans.<br /><br />Finally, the packaging was a little flimsy and my beans were intermingled when they arrived.  This was a bummer, since there are flavors that share a color and are hard to differentiate (like lemon and ginger, and the black cherry, cranberry and pomegranate) so if there was a flavor I disliked, it was hard to avoid it until I learned to distinguish the slight color or textural variations.  Some of the confusion could have been avoided by not putting like-colored beans in the "cubby" right next to one another, as lemon and ginger.<br /><br />All in all, a delectable bean with some very interesting flavors and natural coloringflavoring!
