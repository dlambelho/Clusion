I have been feeding Blue Buffalo almost exclusively for about eight years now, and couldn't be happier. Prior to switching to Blue, one of my cats, who was twelve then, was losing fur to a point where she was bald nearly everywhere that she could reach, as she was licking and chewing constantly. She looked like she had mange, except I don't think that cats get mange. I took her to a couple of veterinarians. One insisted that she was overly sensitive to fleas, although we weren't finding any fleas. That didn't make sense to me since I had inspected her carefully and I knew that, with five cats, if one of them had fleas, they'd all have fleas. Another vet put her on steroids, which seemed to help some, except that it changed her personality, and that wasn't something I was willing to leave her on for life. Then someone mentioned food allergies, particularly to corn, soy and wheat. Not knowing any better, I had been feeding Science Diet, which was recommended by the veterinarian.<br /><br />I looked for something without corn, soy and wheat. At first, I tried some other premium food, and her fur started to grow back. I tried a few different premium foods, always making sure that they did not include corn, soy or wheat. Some my cats liked better than others, but I didn't find any that all of my cats liked. Learning more about feline nutrition, I began looking at what the foods did have in them, as well as what they did not have.<br /><br />When I came across Blue Buffalo, the idea of the Life Source Bits made sense to me. We began feeding Blue to our cats and all of them loved it. My wife came across one of the Blue representatives in a Petco store, and she and I both ended up working for Blue for a few years, both in Maine and in North Carolina. It was nice to be able to represent a product that I believed in entirely. I no longer work for Blue, but I continue to feed Blue Buffalo to my cats. The only kibble that they eat is made by Blue Buffalo, and about fifty percent of their canned food is also made by Blue.<br /><br />Three of my cats are twenty-one now, and a fourth is ten years old. The fifth died of cancer when she was a few months short of twenty-four years old. Given the age of my three older cats, I am a little more concerned about their hydration now than before, so I feed them more canned food than I would if they were younger. They appreciate variety in their canned food so I mix some other brands of premium canned food whose ingredients I approve of. Even with the canned food, however, all of my cats like the Blue Buffalo selections, and at least one of my cats will turn away from nearly every other brand that I have tried, the exception being Petco's premium house brand, Soulistic, which has good ingredients and all of my cats like it.<br /><br />I rarely feed them kibble other than Blue. Although I alternate between the Blue Buffalo kibble selections from time to time, my cats never tire of Blue Buffalo, and I wouldn't want to be without the good results that I have seen from it.<br /><br />All three of my twenty-one year old cats are healthy and active. Veterinarians who haven't seen them before invariably guess their ages as being a third to a fourth of what their ages really are. One of them has arthritis but you'd never know it as long as she's taking her supplement - another reason for feeding them canned food each day, since I can hide the supplement in the canned food. Other than that, they have no issues whatsoever. They play, they fight, and they climb. Being cats, of course they also sleep a lot.<br /><br />Their fur is beautiful, even the one who was once bald. Here's another huge plus, one that I wasn't allowed to talk about while I was representing Blue Buffalo. Although my cats are allowed to go outside whenever they want to (in Maine, it's not as if they're playing in the street), I have not had a problem with fleas since I began feeding them Blue Buffalo. This has been true even in summers when neighbors are complaining about fleas being a particular problem. If they are outside in the summer, I take sensible precautions and comb them out frequently, particularly if I see one of them scratching, but I haven't seen more than three fleas in eight years. My cats are not treated with poisons, either. Blue Buffalo is not a remedy for fleas, but good nutrition assists the cat's natural defenses, I believe.<br /><br />One thing that many people are concerned about when considering Blue Buffalo or another premium brand of cat food is the price. Yes, you will pay more per pound for Blue Buffalo than you would for a store brand. When you look beyond that, you will see the cost savings, however.<br /><br />Cats don't digest corn, soy or wheat very well. When you feed a cheaper cat food (and even some of the more expensive brands) that consists mostly of stuff they can't digest, much of what you are paying for ends up in the litter box. I can assure you that my litter boxes don't fill nearly as quickly now, as they did when I was feeding Science Diet to my cats, and what is in there doesn't smell as bad. The last time I checked, Science Diet was even more expensive than Blue Buffalo. Whatever you are feeding your cats, if the chief ingredients are corn, soy, wheat, or something else that isn't meat, poultry or fish, you might consider that you are feeding the litter box, so you should add in the extra cost of cat litter.<br /><br />I don't know how many people I have come across who talk about their cats, half the age of my own, as being old. Many people are paying high veterinary bills for health problems that may not be necessary if they were eating a healthier diet. With three twenty-one year old cats and one ten year old, my cats see the veterinarian rarely, and only for preventative checkups. Even the one with arthritis is successfully treated with Cosequin, an over the counter supplement that I buy here on Amazon.com.<br /><br />I won't go so far as to say that Blue Buffalo is the only cat food that you should feed to your cat. In canned foods, there are several other good choices, some of which I buy as treats for those of my cats who like them. There are other dry cat foods that use real meat as the first ingredient, and which avoid corn, soy and wheat. My cats prefer Blue, and I think there is something to be said for the Life Source Bits that are found only in Blue.<br /><br />That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it.
