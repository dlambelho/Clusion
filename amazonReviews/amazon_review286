I tried to like it and I know it's hard to make good gluten free pasta, so I gave them 2 stars for effort. But due to the sticky tacky texture, questionable nutritional value, and high price, as a pasta loving Italian-American who has been eating all kinds of pasta for over 50 years, I can tell you that if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. I'd rather just pour my home made tomato sauce over brown rice, add some veggies, maybe a few shrimp. I know that's more like a Spanish dish, but like I said, I'd rather give up pasta than have to eat this stuff.<br /><br />My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally but I include photos above to prove I've tried it. But if you do choose to buy this and can't get it locally, Amazon Prime is the way to go.

It was so chewy it stuck to my teeth. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried it at 10 minutes and it was uneatable. It was best at 12 minutes - cooked over full flame in a full rolling boil in plenty of water. Be sure to use lots of water. Unlike regular pasta, when cooking pasta made from rice or other flours you can't really get away with crowding the pot.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true pasta-like texture. As an Italian-American from NY who has been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years, this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought, and I don't think it has "true pasta-like" texture as they claim. Like I said above, sticky, chewy, tacky.<br /><br />> It felt like wet cement in my stomach. I'm not exaggerating. It made me painfully constipated.<br /><br />> Since it is not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, I feel it's not really that healthy for you. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice or products made out of white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> It's made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But as I've mentioned in some other reviews, poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it. Sorry if that sounds crude, but I think it really goes make a good point.<br /><br />> It is expensive, but if you have already tried this and like it and can't get it locally, then Amazon Prime is the way to go. Ask me how to get Amazon Prime free shipping perks. But I don't see it being worth the price.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />> Organic<br /><br />> Gluten Free<br /><br />> Kosher (circle K symbol)<br /><br />> Produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, or eggs.<br /><br />> The manufacturer is one of a select few in Italy who are authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health to produce gluten free pasta. The factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle. Independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the United States on each lot before the products are distributed in this country.<br /><br />> The actual taste is a little like regular pasta. But I'm being generous saying this since the texture was so bad I couldn't finish more than a few fork fulls.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS: (same as all of their pastas)<br /><br />Organic Rice Flour, Organic Rice Starch, Organic Potato Starch, Organic Soy Flour (and water is used)<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />COMPANY INFORMATION:<br /><br />Euro-USA Trading Co., Inc.
