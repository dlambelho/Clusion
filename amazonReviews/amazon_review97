I bought this by mistake. I thought it was made from whole grain brown rice, my bad. I had it before (fusili, same ingredients) and didn't like it then but I tried it again anyway. In short, due to the texture, questionable healthiness factor, and price, as a pasta loving Italian-American, if I had to eat gluten free I'd rather give up pasta than eat this stuff. But I give them kudos for trying. My full review is below. This review will not show as a verified Amazon purchase because I bought mine locally but I include photos too, partly to prove I bought it, partly to show I threw it in the garbage after my taste test.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />> Thick. The actual wall of the pasta is simply too thick. I felt it should be thinner for better mouth feel.<br /><br />> Tacky, sticky, chewy, just plain icky. It was so chewy, sticking to my teeth, I felt like I was biting into a mushy granola bar or candy bar. I tried taste testing it at 8 minutes cooking time, 9 minutes, 10, 11, and 12 minutes. Recommend cooking time is 10 minutes but I tried all of them because I did buy this in the past and didn't like the texture then, so I wanted to give it every opportunity to cook properly this time. It was bad at all cooking times but it was most palatable at 12 minutes of a full rolling boil in plenty of water.<br /><br />> They claim it has a true al dente pasta-like texture. Well, I'm an Italian from NY and have been eating pasta of all kinds regularly for over 50 years and this isn't like any pasta I've tried before, home made or store bought. So no, I don't think it gives "true pasta-like" texture as they claim. As I mention above, sticky icky.<br /><br />> It sat like a led weight in my stomach after eating about 2 ounces (dry weight) with home made fresh tomato sauce. Horrible feeling in my stomach even an hour later, like I'd just swallowed wet cement. I'm sure it will constipate me just like eating too much white bread so I just downed a fiber drink to help it move through me as fast as possible.<br /><br />> Not made from whole grain brown rice, it's white, which I feel means it's not really that healthy for you. But that's not the reason I gave it just 2 stars. It's not advertised as whole grain or brown rice so I wouldn't take away stars due to this. I just don't think people should eat white rice if they can get whole grain brown rice instead.<br /><br />> Made from rice, potato, and soy. The Potato is white, just like the rice. And soy, well more and more we're finding out too much soy in the diet is not good for you. For centuries soy was mainly used as a seasoning, it's only in modern times food manufacturer's are trying to shove it down our throats in any form they can. I feel the combination of white rice, white starchy potato and questionable soy is just too much for me to recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />> Being organic and gluten free is the only thing I can see good about this stuff. But poop can be organic and gluten free but that doesn't mean you should eat it.<br /><br />> Expensive. I purchased mine at a local store for $3.99 (one 12 ounce bag). Compared to regular pasta, which you can buy for about .75 per 16 ounces on sale. I honestly don't think it's worth the money. Currently sold here for $4.26 per bag ($25.56 for 6 bags, less if you use Amazon Prime). If you have already tried this stuff and like it and don't mind paying four times the price of regular pasta, and can't get it locally, then Amazon Prime is the way to go. Ask me how to get Amazon Prime free shipping perks. I tend to think most specialty food items are over priced because the manufacturer thinks they can price their items high, but maybe bionaturae (being relatively small family owned company) is so small that they need to price items so high to make a profit. Not sure, but either way I don't see it being worth the price.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />> Organic<br /><br />> Gluten Free<br /><br />> Kosher (circle K symbol)<br /><br />> Produced at a dedicated gluten free facility with no risk of cross contamination with dairy, tree nuts, peanuts, or eggs.<br /><br />> The manufacturer is one of a select few in Italy who are authorized by the Italian Ministry of Health to produce gluten free pasta. The factory tests for the presence of gluten during each production cycle. Independent testing is also done at a laboratory in the United States on each lot before the products are distributed in this country.<br /><br />> The actual taste is a little like regular pasta. But I'm being generous saying this since the texture was so bad I nearly gagged on it.<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />INGREDIENTS:<br /><br />Organic Rice Flour, Organic Rice Starch, Organic Potato Starch, Organic Soy Flour<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />NUTRITIONAL FACTS:<br /><br />Serving Size: 2 ounces<br />Servings per container: 6<br /><br />Calories: 200<br />Calories From Fat: 10<br />Total Fat: 1g<br />Saturated Fat: 0<br />Trans Fat: 0<br />Cholesterol: 0<br />Sodium: 0<br />Total Carbs: 42g (14% daily recommended amount)<br />Dietary Fiber 2g (doubtful)<br />Sugars: 1g<br />Protein: 5g<br /><br />~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~<br /><br />COMPANY INFORMATION:<br /><br />Euro-USA Trading Co., Inc.
