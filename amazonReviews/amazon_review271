I love chocolate and I love tea and it seems only natural to me that the two should be combined into something delicious. Which chocolate tea is the best? I tried four - two loose and two that are pre-packaged in sachets. The four I tried included: Tisano Cacao Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a>, SerendipiTea ChocolaTea , Guayaki's Organic Mate Chocolatte <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0001CXRKM">Mate Chocolatte Tea Bags</a>, Zhena's Chocolate Chai - Red Herbal Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0030LXA0I">Chocolate Chai Tea by Zhena's Gypsy Tea</a>. I like aromatic teas that are packed with flavor and are distinctly chocolaty. Based on these points, here is how I ranked these four teas:<br /><br />SerendipiTea ChocolaTea -- This is my second favorite chocolate tea. It is a loose, black tea so it has caffeine. Before brewing, it has a sweet chocolate smell. Both taste and smell are very much influenced by vanilla. While it has a very rich body, I consider it leagues away from the Tisano Cacao Tea <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0031TJ0X0">Tisano Organic Chocolate Tea</a> in terms of raw chocolate taste. The product is about sixteen dollars for 8 ounces. The user needs about a teaspoon of the tea for a full bodied cup. Steeping time is four to five minutes. Ingredients: chocolate, vanilla, rooibos, black tea. According to the product packaging, this product contains trace amounts of dairy. The product reaches the user in a recyclable box.<br /><br />Tisano Cacao Tea - This tea trumps all other chocolate inspired teas I have tried. It tastes like a watered down hot chocolate. The tea has a very rich, dark chocolate smell. It is a loose tea so you will need a tea ball or brewing basket (I like the Finum brewing basket <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D07MCU">Finum Goldton Filters</a>.). The steep time is 4-5 minutes. The Tisano Cacao Tea had the smallest number of ingredients - 100% organic cacao shell. The product comes in a small, reusable tin. In terms of cost, expect to pay about fifteen dollars for four ounces. A serving size is three teaspoons per 8 oz cup of water. It is dairy and sugar free and the packaging indicates that it has less caffeine than green tea or decaf coffee. The packaging indicates that this is a product of Venezuela, Peru, Dominican Republic and Ecuador.<br /><br />Zhena's Chocolate Chai - Red Herbal Tea: If you are in a rush and don't want to fool with loose tea, Zhena's makes good tea. Whether this particular blend can be called "chocolate chai" is debatable in my world. If this were a blind tasting, I would never guess this was intended as a chocolate flavored tea. The first ingredient is cacao powder but than followed by a fairly long list of additional ingredients that seem to cancel out the chocolate. I taste a lot of cinnamon, nutmeg and cloves. This is a tasty tea but largely absent of chocolate flavoring. This tea would make a great dessert tea as it is caffeine free. I drink it fairly frequently in the evening. It also comes in a tin that can be refilled with other tea, pencils or knick knacks and/or recycled. Ingredients: Cacao powder, rooibos, cinnamon, chirory root roasted, ginger, chocolate flavoring, licorice root, cardamom, cloves, nutmeg, shortbread flavoring, orange peel, pepper. This product is about six dollars for a tin with 22 sachets and the product made in the United States.<br /><br />Guayaki's Organic Mate Chocolatte -  While this produces a decent cup of tea, out of the four I tried, this was my least favorite. This is a pre-packaged tea that is not as chocolate flavored as I had hoped. Other ingredients overshadow the cocoa flavor. There is a fairly strong stevia aftertaste. If you are a yerba fan, this tea might be great for you since there is a subtle hint of cocoa. I will also note there is no dominant chocolate scent. According to the product packaging, a tea bag contains the caffeine equivalent of 1/4 cup of coffee. Because the product comes in tea bags, you don't have to fool with brewing baskets or tea balls. The brew time on this tea is fairly long - about seven minutes for a good cup so you may need to cover your mug to retain heat or accept that you will be drinking a possibly lukewarm cup of tea. This product is about six dollars for 16 tea bags. It can be found at many grocery stores and on third party sites for this price. Ingredients: yerba mate, cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon, stevia and clove. Each tea bag is individually packaged and all come in a box that can be recycled.
