Vernor's.  VERNOR'S!  If you grew up in Michigan, or even lived there for a while, you've probably seen it.  Here in NC, when I ask for it people look at me like...well, like a Yankee.<br /><br />Canada Dry might be a bigger brand.  Schewppe's might be better-known.<br /><br />Canada Dry and Schweppe's are sugar water.  They're not ginger ale.  You want ginger ale, you want Vernor's.<br /><br />I sound like an advertisement.  I should be.  I am.  This stuff is wonderful.  It boggles my mind that Vernor's is not a national brand; I figure the other manufacturers must be paying them to not compete, because those other kids know:  if Vernor's had the kind of distribution and availability that those other alleged ginger ales have, those other alleged ginger ales would have to be removed from the market.<br /><br />I don't have any real knowledge of this, in fact I'm making it up as I type, but I have a pet conspiracy theory (that I made up, just now) that the whole reason Cadbury/Schweppe's bought the Vernor's brand was so if worse came to worst, they could always change the name of the place to Cadbury/Vernor's.<br /><br />Spicy, bubbly, with a ginger-and-vanilla-and-who-cares-what-else mix of flavors aged for four years in wooden barrels, Vernor's is the oldest soda in the US, and it's still the best.<br /><br />All over the world, people drink 7-up for an upset stomach; in Michigan, we drink Vernor's.  People make root beer or 7-up or sprite 'floats,' with vanilla ice cream.  In Michigan, it's Vernor's and Hudsonville.  During the holiday season, some people have egg nog; we have warm Vernor's.  Some people have spiced cider; we have warm Vernor's.  Some people drink rum and Coke; we drink rum and Vernor's.<br /><br />Some soft drink connoisseurs suggest that the taste of Vernor's is closer to some very small, regional, 'hot' ginger beers.  I've had a few of these myself, and while they're not bad...they're not Vernor's.  Certainly, if you think the national brands are how ginger ale is supposed to taste...well you, my friend, are grievously misled by the propaganda of the anti-Vernor's cabal.  Fortunately, I am here to save you, rip those blinders off your tongue (have a mixed metaphor) and show you the One True Path Of Ginger Aleightenment...the Path, of VERNOR'S.<br /><br />It is my eternal torment that even in this age of YouTube and Amazon.Com, I cannot find for my life a copy of a Christmas television commercial from the 1980's for Vernor's featuring Paul Stanley from KISS.  All you see is a goblet of Vernor's being passed from hand to hand, down a line, all beautiful hands with long nails and red polish, and the goblet is handed to Mr. Stanley, who looks dead at the camera and says (as only He can):  "You warm your Vernor's your way...and I'll warm my Vernor's...MY way."  That's some classic 80's regional advertising right there.<br /><br />I digress.  Vernor's!  It cures cancer!  It will bring you closer in spirit and action to the deity of your choosing!  It will reverse the aging process!  Take two inches off your waistline!  Stop spam e-mail in its tracks!  Ensure that the next federal election brings us true leaders of vision, courage, wisdom, and honor!  It endows all parents with patience, all children with obedience, all husbands with virility and courage, all wives with allure and wit!  Why, I bet if we sent a crate of this stuff to those ol' Osama bin Laden, he'd just surrender to get his hands on more!<br /><br />That's it.  That's IT!  Send cases of Vernor's to all the government, religious, and social leaders of the world, and it's a sure thing that we won't have to 'Imagine' world peace anymore!  Why, those antagonistic ol' dictators and politicians, insurgents, guerillas, rebels, factions, warlords, and the like will be so busy giggling at the bubbles in their noses they won't be able to THINK about war!  THAT'S RIGHT!  VERNOR'S IS THE KEY TO WORLD PEACE!!!11!1!<br /><br />*looks around and realizes the entire room has gone dead quiet*<br /><br />*ahem*<br /><br />Okay, maybe it's not the key to world peace.  But it's the best darn soda I've ever had.  It's next-to-impossible to find here in NC - although I notice someone has *finally* started distributing Squirt here - in fact, I can't say that I've ever seen it here.  My mom still has a bottle or two - GLASS, 20OZ BOTTLES WITH METAL SCREW-TOP CAPS - stashed in a hole someplace, but that's it.  Thank heaven for Amazon's new grocery item selection; they're far better priced than the small handful of other online distributors.<br /><br />Vernor's:  It really IS The One Of A Kind Soft Drink, With A One Of A Kind Taste.<br /><br />(Disclaimer:  Neither I nor anyone close to me is employed by Vernor's, Cadbury-Schweppe's, Coca-Cola, Amazon.Com, or any other trademark holder mentioned in this review.

Do NOT buy Vernor's in two-liter plastic bottles unless you plan on using it as soon as it's opened; it goes flat in about four seconds.  I can't speak to the plastic bottles sold here...but I'll be buying the cans, just to stay on the safe side.)
