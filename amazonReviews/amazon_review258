<span class="tiny"> Length:: 9:39 Mins<br /><br /></span>This video features JUST VEGGIES [from the Just Tomatoes brand of dried fruits and vegetables], showing the product "close up and personal."  Included in this review are several other Amazon products which for me are related to the dried veggies [among them a couple food and health books on my KINDLE].  I've listed these below [with hyperlinks to Amazon product pages].<br /><br />It could probably go without saying that the dragonfly and ladybug shown in the video were not purchased from Amazon! They just happened to cross my path in such a way as to become video stars.<br /><br />The dragonfly was found lifeless but perfectly preserved.  Of course it did not "come with" my Kindle, as my slip of the tongue in the video may have implied. The ladybug somehow found its way from my country kitchen onto the top of the container of JUST VEGGIES after I had broken the seal and opened the tub.  I didn't notice the  ladybug until I was showing the product in the video.<br /><br />According to my holistic doctor and my personal viewpoint [and studies of books by several medical professionals] the severe magnesium deficiency and soybean intolerance I unfortunately have is aggravated [if not caused] by food alterations and additives, especially soybean products.  Due to this, I've been forced into the dreaded and difficult task of searching for foods free of chemically synthesized or genetically altered intrusions.<br /><br />This painful and frightening situation has been blessedly eased by Amazon's variety of products suiting alternate tastes and needs. Some of these products are helping me slowly regain health and flavor in my life by working around what I've observed and read about an increasing preponderance of synthesized additives and soybean GMOs which are impregnating more and more foods in the marketplace... with some of them listed under insane misnomers like "natural flavors" as discovered by people who have serious soy allergies [genetically modified organisms don't seem precisely natural to me].<br /><br />The cherished blessing in this forced change in shopping, cooking, and eating is that food I'm preparing now is beginning again to taste like JUST FOOD, making my stomach growl like it hasn't done for a few decades!<br /><br />As for my uses so far of the Just Veggies, it is a fantastic, flavor lush, light luxury snack.  It also tastes great reconstituted and warmed in the microwave with water, coconut oil, cooked diced potatoes, fresh cilantro, and chopped green onions.  I like Just Veggies best [the use seems most efficient] combined into a bowl of rice, quinoa, or noodles for added color, flavor, and nutritive value.  I'm attempting to stretch the dried veggies by thinking of them like Just Roasted Garlic, more as a spice instead of a main dish.<br /><br />Here's to natural flavor which comes from the food itself, or from spices or integrity enhancers added by an old fashioned cook,<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Here's the promised list of books and products [regarding "Just Veggies"; I purchased the 4 oz 4 pk, but might try the 8 oz 2 pk size on this page next time] purchased on Amazon which are related directly or indirectly to this review:<br /><br />1. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FGCD2C">Just Tomatoes Just Roasted Garlic, 1-Pound Bag</a><br />2. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />3. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray</a><br />4. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002E62HXQ">Magnesium Chloride Flakes 2.2 lb (35.27 oz) Flakes</a> [The Zechstein web site says they can't recommend making your own brine water from the flakes, but after studying the trace residuals which come out of the breakdown of the originally mined brine water, I've formed an intuitive opinion that there might be an advantage for me to sometimes using this reconstituted liquid form from the Zechstein flakes.  I use it in cooking and cleaning.]<br />5. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ELLBES">Pacific Salt Coarse Sea Salt, 2.2 Pound Bags (Pack of 4)</a> Himalayan and other brands are good options, too.]<br />6. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/034549458X">The Magnesium Miracle</a><br />7. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1583332049">The Coconut Oil Miracle (Previously published as The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil)</a><br />[My reviews of the above and related products each give their own details and slants, which can enhance what I've said here and in this video.]
