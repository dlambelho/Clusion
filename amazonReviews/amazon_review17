I have 4 felines of my own and feed the one who sleeps in my backyard who has been stopping by to eat supper on an  almost daily basis for 3 years.<br />I am never surprised at the things my finiky, spoiled kittys will turn their collective noses up about. I have learned through testing and error what they will generally eat, but they never cease to amaze me: will not touch crab, shrimp, calf liver or lamb. Usually they are pretty good about all things seafood though. I am aware that the older female is not fond of food in the form of Pate. However, I have two kittens who will generally eat whatever is put before them (the no crab, shrimp, liver or lamb rules were in place when they arrived.) The older male is better about taking on new things than the older female. He WILL eat pate.<br />This particular item Friskies Cat Foof Classic Pate, 4 flavor Seafood Variety Pack was purchased primarily for the outside kitty who is not technically mine. I buy Friskies food for him all the time. It is so convenient to have these Packs set up on Subscribe and Save. They are delivered to my front door and I do not have to lug them home from the local grocers. That gives almost everything that arrives from Amazon on a routine basis a 3 star rating from me to start with. Usually Subscribe and Save Items work UP to a 4 star or 5 star rating from there. I have no shame, but say with gratitude that those items have a favorable positive predjudice from me going for them from the beginning! This Pack was no exception. I thought my older female might refuse it, but expected to hysteria from the others, outside Kitty inclded.<br />All four inside cats are now getting a half of a 3 oz can at their back feeding station at supper time. I used to give them all a whole can, but jealousy of the kittens is still present, so each gets a half and then I go to fix dinner for my outside, feral guy who is known simply as "Yellow Kitty."<br />Now, I am not dense, I realize that the four of mine were accostomed to an entire 3 oz can each for supper at one point. Then the green eyed monster of Jealousy appeared on the scene and brought along with her Screeches and Skirmishes over what bowl belonged to whom (Each had his own station which was 10 feet away from the next fur person. Squabbles ensued anyway.) So the Front Feeding Station now has two bowls which hold a half can each and in the next room is the Kitten Station with two bowls which hold a half can. Everyone circulates around and disagreements have almost disappeared. I admit to the use on the elder cats of a calming collar: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003SLYWLQ">Calming Cat Collar 1 Count</a> and to the use of Feliway throughout the house.:<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00608SVD4">Feliway Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial Electric Diffuser Kit with Vial</a>.<br />Having become an artist at cat rigamarole, I usually suceed in finding foods that the cats will eat. Friskies is a dietary staple. I receive The The Meaty Bits and the Seafood variety pack plus the Pouches of Gravy Sensations on a regular rotating basis. EVERYBODY will eat those. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00376301U">Friskies Prime Filets Seafood Selections Variety Pack, Seafood, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJG2H2">Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Variety Pack, 24-Count</a><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KIB8K">Friskies Gravy Sensations Pouch Favorites, 6-Flavor Variety Pack, 3-Ounce Pouches (Pack of 24)</a>.<br />The Pates being reviewed came up on Amazon's Recommendations For Me a few days ago. I was thrilled. This was a 32 pack instead of the 24 Packs that I usually get. So I ordered it right away. I was just about out of large canned food and none was due until mid January.<br />During my feeding production tonight, I gave part of one can of food, thereby using 3 of the varieties, placed at various feeding stations. I paid no attention to who ate what but headed out to feed the outside boy, Yellow Kitty. Salmon flavor had not gone to an indoor cat, so I gave it to him, along with a can of Mariner's Stew. Yellow Kitty eats a lot in the winter when it is cold and hunting is difficult. He is only fed in the evening, so will eat a lot at his first sitting, then nibble on and off until his next feeding.<br />Today was a BUSY DAY. It is 21ntin days until Christmas and I still have many things to wrap. Little last minute sales precipitate unplanned purchases, and that means more wrapping, and, what is for Christmas Dinner. Better be on that too!<br />So, I paid little attention to who ate what and went busily on my way. It must have also been "noisily" on my was as no one mentioned a thing.<br />As I was preparing for bed, I started turning off lights. The back door light was on. Yellow Kitty is fed by the back door. His wet food bowls were almost full though the dry food was almost depleted, which was unusual. Usually he eats the wet food first. Hmmmmmm.....<br />Front feeding station: Friskies Meaty bits which were a leftover, had disappeared. Otherwise, it appeared that one or two bites had been taken and then the rest was left. Kitten Room: Bowls were full, just as they were in the back feeding station. Oh well, I went to bed.<br />The next morning, bowls were still full. Breakfast of a different variety was served and gobbled down by all.<br /><br />This scenario took place several times over the next 10 days. Yellow Kitty, who lives outside, finally began to give in and eat about half his normal portion. My inside kids continued to nibble at the pate. They then ate some dry food and waited a bit, THEN BEGAN TO COMPLAIN LOUDLY FOR SOMETHING GOOD TO EAT! I finally caved and gave them a different menu.<br /><br />This product recieves 2 Stars which represents "I don't like it." I really would not personally have feeling about the Pate and would let the cats vote. HOWEVER 1. I have had to clean up several uneaten meals which means picking up and doing something with 4-6 bowls of disgusting looking brown stuff which purports that it is Cat Food; however, my guys will not eat it. 2. I have to delete my Subscribe and Save order. It ism't much of a pain to do so, but I like to think that if I put an item on S&S, I will give Amazon their money's worth and reorder the item several times. 3. Also, I now have about 3/4 of the pack in the cupboard and that must be taken out and donated to someone. It adds up to more work than I had in mind.<br /><br />I guess that is the 2 star bottom line: my cats will not eat it and it causes a disposal dilemma. Gabriella, Trinity, Mischief, Mercy, Yellow Kitty and I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT because none of my 5 Fur People will eat it.
