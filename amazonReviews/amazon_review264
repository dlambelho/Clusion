I bought these pods along with the Delonghi Latissima 720 machine and they work flawless. They did fit the machine and are perfectly ejected after use.<br />It seems that some Amazon customers are giving bad reviews for this product because it is cheaper and it's not Nespresso, which is not the point.<br />Firstly, these capsules are green and compostable. They cannot be a "copy" of Nespresso pods that are in aluminum, which is highly polluting. ECC capsules would be a "copy" if they were made in aluminum too!<br />Secondly, the ECC capsules are not that cheap, there is only a difference of 10 cents between Nespresso and ECC: I am not sure that people that bought a Nespresso machine and used to drink Nespresso pods are interested in a bargain of 10 cents because if they wanted to make real savings, they should have used ground coffee and stovetop espresso makers!!!<br /><br />As a result,<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS NOT FOR YOU IF:<br />* you already have your favorite Nespresso "grand crus",<br />* you like the look of the aluminum capsules,<br />* you love George Clooney Nespresso commercials and keep saying "What else?" each time you drink a Nespresso coffee,<br />* you have the feeling to buy something luxurious each time you go to Nespresso club and you like it,<br />* you don't care about the planet.<br /><br />THIS PRODUCT IS FOR YOU IF:<br />* you don't have a favorite Nespresso "grand crus", and you like espressos in general,<br />* you are not convinced by the recycling Nespresso thing because they did not try really hard to increase 5% of the total current recycled capsules(1),<br />* you think that ECC capsules is the answer to the Nespresso question "What else?",<br />* you like the idea of doing REALLY something to reduce the amount of polluting materials in your daily waste and think that recycling aluminum is not enough,<br />* you don't care about the Nespresso club.<br /><br />(1) If Nespresso/Nestle did care that much about recycling, they would have entice their customers by giving them coupons for empty capsules brought back (as for the recycle of glass for example).<br /><br />Another thing, I saw a lot of reviews saying that these green pods do not work on Citiz or Nespresso branded machines. I am not even surprised. Nestle made everything he could to prevent the Ethical coffee Company to sell their products, but ECC found success in Europe since 2010. If this product was not working and was responsible for breaking machines, we should know it! As a consequence, I am not a conspiracy person but I would not be suprised that some of the bad reviews could come from Nestle itself. We are in an espresso-capsule-war, so this is business!<br /><br />P.S. 1 : I am not working for the Ethical Coffee Company and they don't give me any money for rating their products. I am just a green costumer concerned about his carbon footprint.<br />P.S. 2 : The espresso taste is good! I used to drink espressos and ristrettos from semi automatic professional machines at work, but I did not want to do all the process by myself, so espresso capsule process is the perfect alternative for me! I am not a Nespresso aficionado so I am just talking about espresso here.<br />P.S. 3 : You have to firmly lower the level of your machine with these capsules. FIRMLY. The first time I tried, I was afraid time to break my Delonghi super expensive machine, but it's ok. It's seems to be due to the biodegradable capsule material that is less hard than aluminum (obvious).<br />P.S. 4 : It would be nice if the Ethical Coffee Company could put all theirs different products in a single degustation box, in this way you could choose your favorite flavors and only buy them. Because if you do not like the taste you are stuck with 49 capsules... it's a bit rude!<br />P.S. 5 : It would be great (and logical) if the ECC capsules were really ethical: organic and/or fair trade certified.<br /><br />>>April, 25th 2012<br />After drinking ECC capsules for more than 2 months now, my conclusion is that -- at comparable intensities and blends -- the espresso tastes of both Nespresso and ECC capsules are good, and the differences between Nespresso and ECC are subtle. Since some capsules are compostable while other pollute like hell, I will stick with these green capsules because I hope soon to turn them (coffee+capsules) in compost for my palm trees.<br /><br />>>May, 2nd 2012<br />I've just started to compost the ECC capsules, I am very excited! The capsules should break down in 6 months according to the standard EN#13432.<br />I will let you know how quick they turn into compost! :)<br /><br />Go green!
