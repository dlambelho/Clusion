Mandarin Orange, such a remiscent joy, reminds me of our search for last of the Great Panda Kings.<br /><br />It was the Winter of 1935, Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, our regular liaison with the Crown, informed us of an outlandish tale relayed to him by one of his Chinese servants.  Pyung Li, who in his formative years, had traveled up the Yangtze River to Wuhan, a small provincial village established during the Han Dynasty.  Pyung Li recalled stories the locals told of an ancient race of "Bear-Men", (silly Pyung Li, as all educated men are well aware that the Panda is not a bear at all, which is why Pyung Li was a servant), who lived further along the banks of the Yangtze River.  Pyung Li spoke in abject horror of the actions the so called "Bear-Men" (stupid Pyung Li) perpetrated among the locals, sordid details of which decorum prevents in such a noble forum as this one.  Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale, as many nobles, a fine swordsman, a notorious womanizer and a lover of treasure, was seduced by the tale of glorious fortunes held on by the Bear-Men.  "But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale", Pyung Li quivered, "the one call 'Panda King', he no return traveler alive, they say, Panda King make suit out of inside of traveler".<br /><br />But Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale would not be persuaded, as the great treasure he sought, would definitely be his.<br /><br />Sir Algernon Freeman-Mitford, 1st Baron of Redesdale offered us Pyung Li's as a our guide for our perilous journey up the Yangtze River.  I requisitioned my usual crew, Boson's Mate Micklegal and First Mate Tignor, the most trusted of my crew.  We packed up the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendhish and so it was that we set sail for the Far East.<br /><br />Many weeks later, we found ourselves alone on the River Yangtze, seeking the treasure of the Great Panda King.  Pyung Li shivered in horror as the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish inched further up the river, her hull softly swaying in the friscilating dusk.  "Boson's Mate Micklegal", I shouted, "all hands on deck!".  "Gather the crew.  Brew us up one of your fine cups of Earl Grey, a tea fit for Kings."  (Everyone knowing well, that Earl Grey, "The Earl", English of course, being the finest of all the teas.).  With the warm deep taste of Earl Grey in our bellies, we almost did not hear the noises along the banks.<br /><br />"Panda King and Bear-Men, he near", Pyung Yung whispered.  "Dammit Pyung Li", bellowed First Mate Tignor, "you are on her majesty's H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish, you are in the presence of fine Englishman, will you please speak the language of the Kings in proper grammatical form".<br /><br />"Great Panda King, he know we close, he send scout, he track us!", Pyung Li warned.  And out of the blue, the starboard side of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took on a full assault against it's hull.  The crew of the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish took up their battle positions, ready for a full on naval assault against the Great Panda King's army.  Boson's Mate Micklegal almost didn't realize the fresh liquid running down his arm until it was too late.<br /><br />"They're throwing bloody fruit at us!", yelled First Mate Tignor.  "Bloody Citrus!"  No one noticed Pyung Li scurry below deck.<br /><br />Before anyone realized, we were all on shore, sitting in front of the "Bear-Men".  In fact, the "Bear-Men" were not bears, nor men, they were cute cuddly Giant Panda bears, chewing on endless reeds of bamboo.  The leader of the Giant Panda's, in fact, the most Giant of them all, was The Great Panda King, the last of his species.  The Great Panda King dropped his bamboo.  With his paw, the Great Panda King rolled the small rounded orange citrus to me.  In his paws, the Giant Panda King took a bite from the rounded small orange citrus and motioned for myself to do in kind.  I did, and I let the luscious citrus run down my throat.  In return, we gave The Great Panda King the H.M.S. Peregrine Cavendish's only copy of the King James Bible.  We exchanged pleasantries and with that, we were gone.<br /><br />Later on the boat, Boson's Mate Micklegal, always the young ing&eacute;nue, set the green tea leaves given to him by Pyung Li into the kettle along with the zest of three of the small round orange citrus.  We decided to call the small rounded orange citrus a "Mandarin Orange", after the name of First Mate Tignor's favorite style of Chinese cooking.  After four minutes, the entire crew filled their bellies with this delicious green tea concoction.  That night, Boson's Mate Micklegal was supposed to sleep next to the small rounded orange citrus protecting it.  Unfortunately, Boson's Mate Micklegal, with an unhealthy addiction to Glen Fiddyich that he found smuggled within the hold, got plastered and did not notice Pyung Li stealing the citrus and sneaking off the H.M.S. Pergrine Cavendish and into the night.<br /><br />When morning came to, we realized we no longer possessed the small rounded orange citrus of our bounty so humbly given up by the Last Great Panda King.  But ever the swift thinker, Boson's Mate Micklegal whipped out the green tea leaves, found some remaining peach and mango from our previous voyage up the Nile, one summer prior and steeped us a damn fine cup of tea.  It was divine.  We loved it so much, we decided to continue calling it "Mandarin Orange" even though we had no "Mandarin Orange's" left.<br /><br />So I thank the hack's at Lipton, for recreating this little masterpiece for all to enjoy.
