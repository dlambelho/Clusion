I've mostly used this coconut oil consistently on my skin for a month now. I have eczema and dry skin spots on my torso.<br /><br />So here's my review and my experience... a rant, and advice, I guess.<br /><br />You have to be pretty consistent with this stuff to see results -- if you're starting out with it, I think. I've been using this for a month at least 2 times a day, and it's in the middle of winter when my skin easily gets dry. I stopped using lotion after learning about its ineffectiveness and how it could be in fact harmful (carcinogenic from parabens and such) -- most of the conventional products anyway that we all find easily in our supermarkets.<br /><br />So I've learned that most health products they sell you don't really eliminate the problems at their roots -- mostly just symptoms, and in fact can contribute to cancer (make-up, shampoos, conditioners, lotions, laundry detergent...) This is a very clever business technique, because the customers will always be coming back for more toxic products that eliminate symptoms, but never completely eliminate the root of the customers' problems.<br /><br />I also learned that skin problems can not only be due to toxic chemicals from your conventional lotions, it can be from toxins that sit on the inside of your body from the junk food you've been ingesting -- this includes highly processed foods, toxic medications, the toxins your skin has absorbed over the years, and maybe even the polluted air you've been breathing.(I've been told by a nutritionist that many skin problems can be helped by colon cleansing and perhaps liver cleansing...).<br /><br />What I'm trying to say is that coconut oil can only do so much (at least, in my one month of experience) on the outside, it's helping just one factor out of many that would contribute to better skin health. But I'd say it's definitely better than using my prescribed topical medication which are basically steroids (betamethasone dipropionate I think). The doctor said not to use it for more than 10 days in a row (my medication), that it's bad that the skin absorbs it. *ahem* you know that doctors are not going to recommend anything other than drugs that are mostly toxic? my dermatologist was definitely giving me carcinogens, which I found out from my doctor -- so she started prescribing me steroids. that can't be good either now can it, especially when she told me that my skin shouldn't absorb too much of it?<br /><br />It's okay to absorb the coconut oil though, because it's non-toxic, nourishing for the skin, anti-fungal, anti-oxidant and can be used internally as well. So definitely, it's great for eczema. You have to be patient with it, though -- it's not harsh and strong like my steroid cream that works in minutes. The coconut oil on the first few applications within the first day or two will still leave your skin pretty dry (in my experience), but I think it's just a matter of your skin getting used to it or something. Or maybe it's a matter of getting it so that your skin is actually nourished, after all those years of using toxic malnourishing lotions.<br /><br />With acne, it's meh. I have acne on my forehead, and I learned that it's due to the oil from my hair... or, your forehead naturally produces more grease than other parts of the body. At least for me. I didn't see that big a difference with coconut oil in the past month, but I solved my acne on my forehead problem with a facial cleanse at a day spa, followed by applying organic jojoba oil on it day and night for almost a week now... and the acne's pretty much calmed down a lot.<br /><br />My face was really smooth when I consistently used the old lotions -- while I was switching to coconut oil for the first few weeks, my face was kind of dry. But now it's back to smooth, possibly even smoother.<br /><br />I bought another jar for my mom, just for general use. She used it on some sort of super itchy rash (possibly some sort of infection, I had no idea) that just wouldn't go away for months. In her experience, after applying coconut oil, her rash itched like crazy while it was greasy. But after a few days of application, it was getting better and itching less frequently. When she applied the coconut oil at night, it wouldn't wake her up anymore from the itchiness like it used to.<br /><br />I will continue to use organic extra virgin coconut oil, and stay away from toxic substances. I think I'm also going to start cooking with coconut oil as well.<br /><br />The only downside to coconut oil in my experience and/or from what I've read and researched, are:<br /><br />if you don't like the smell<br />if you're allergic<br />if you're too lazy/impatient to switch from conventional lotions to coconut oil<br /><br />Coconut oil is too good to be true. As a huge developed country we're so far removed that we had no idea that we don't really need drugs.  At least for good skin and hair and to slow the aging process, stick to organic extra virgin coconut oil. It's probably the only staple "cosmetic" product you'll ever need -- good health leads to beauty.
