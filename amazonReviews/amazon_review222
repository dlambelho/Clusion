I have had all of my dogs on this formula for almost a year.<br /><br />I own a retail store and do a lot of research into what dog foods are best for your pet. I always take ingredients into account when considering a dog food for my dogs. When it comes right down to it, it doesn't matter how great the food if your pet will not eat it. I have also come to realize that every dog is different and what might be considered undesirable for one dog might actually be best for another.<br /><br />It took me a very long while to try the Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28 because of the corn gluten. My dogs were very picky eaters and basically grazers, eating only here and there. Once my dogs tried Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28, you would have thought I had fed them candy as they would consume all that I placed before them.<br /><br />I have 5 Yorkies and 2 poodles - this formula is not just for Yorkies. (I do not breed - they are simply my best little friends.)<br /><br />With the Yorkies, I no longer had to worry about whether they were getting enough to eat. As they stayed on this formula, I began to notice silkier coats and over all well-being not only in appearance but in energy. One of my Yorkies had a very thin coat, since being on this formula her coat has come in thicker and absolutely shines regardless of whether or not she needs a bath or a brushing.<br /><br />The 2 poodles are rescues. The oldest being around 20 years old. She will not eat anything but Yorkshire Terrier Formula 28. She is all bones with zero muscle tone due to ill treatment before she came to me, but I don't have to worry about trying to get her to eat on this formula. Before feeding this food it was hit or miss as to whether or not she would eat. She weighs 3.5 pounds so I worry about her a great deal.<br /><br />The other poodle is young. He came to me with a multitude of ailments, mostly stomach or parasite related. All the dog foods that had meat as the first and 2nd ingredients that also excluded corn, wheat and soy would go right through him. When I tried this formula on him, it was to me a miracle. His mobility problems ceased, no more stool problems - he absorbed the food better as stool size was greatly decreased. He also gained the much need 2 pounds.<br /><br />Overall, my dogs love the taste. They find the shape easier to chew as well. They will turn their heads if I offer them other choices.<br /><br />I wish it was corn free, but it works for them and that is what counts.<br /><br />The largest bag size is limited to 10 lbs.<br /><br />As I said all dogs are different and not all Yorkies are gonna love this formula. I raved about this food to my best friend and had her order from Amazon. She wanted to give her 3 dogs something new as they seemed bored with their food, but when it arrived they would have nothing to do with it. They wanted their Evanger's Pheasant & Brown Rice back immediately! (Which was a favorite of my dogs too, until Royal Canin.) So I would advise that you try a small bag first, even though not as cost effective, to see if your little ones like before getting the 10 lb bag.<br /><br />Full Ingredient List:<br />Chicken meal, brown rice, rice, chicken fat, corn gluten meal, barley, wheat gluten meal, natural chicken flavor, powdered cellulose, dried beet pulp (sugar removed), anchovy oil (source of EPA/DHA), dried brewers yeast, potassium chloride, soya oil, fructo-oligosaccharides, sodium tripolyphosphate, salt, calcium carbonate, taurine, dried brewers yeast extract (source of mannan-oligosaccharides), dried egg product, choline chloride, DL-methionine, Vitamins [DL-alpha tocopherol acetate (source of vitamin E), inositol, niacin supplement, L-ascorbyl-2-polyphosphate (source of vitamin C), D-calcium pantothenate, biotin, pyridoxine hydrochloride (vitamin B6), riboflavin supplement (vitamin B2), thiamine mononitrate (vitamin B1), vitamin A acetate, folic acid, vitamin B12 supplement, vitamin D3 supplement], magnesium oxide, Trace Minerals [zinc proteinate, zinc oxide, ferrous sulfate, manganese proteinate, copper proteinate, copper sulfate, manganous oxide, calcium iodate, sodium selenite], glucosamine hydrochloride, marigold extract (Tagetes erecta L.), tea (green tea extract), L-carnitine, chondroitin sulfate, rosemary extract, preserved with natural mixed tocopherols (source of vitamin E) and citric acid.<br />_______________________________________<br /><br />In my opinion, food ingredients to always avoid are : Animal Digest & UNKNOWN fats and oils which are NOT in this formula : )<br /><br />This formula works for my dogs. There are plenty of foods out there with better ingredients, but this is what is helping my dogs and keeps them VERY happy.<br /><br />I hope this review gives you something to think about when deciding whether or not to try this food.
