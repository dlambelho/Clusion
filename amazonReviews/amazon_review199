They say Life is honored and perpetuated through its meat, its water, its oil, its presence.<br /><br />In my opinion, EVAGold, and the Nutiva brand of coconut oil shown in the video, are among the highest qualities available, of life healing offerings from this sacred gift of a tree.  I had sensed this cold pressed oil's uncanny value as soon as I saw a picture of a jar of EVAGold on Swanson's product list on Amazon.  I had come to trust Swanson [as much as I continue to trust Amazon] from purchases of several types of magnesium supplements including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0026RCMAG">Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz Spray</a>.<br /><br />Reading Bruce Fife's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q360CS">The COCONUT OIL MIRACLE</a>, provided necessary information for working  with this fruit.  Reading that book also clarified my previous belief in the healing nutrition in coconut oil, and in these brands' production purity [other excellent brands are also available; these two are just the ones I've used successfully so far].  My experience of using this type of cold pressed, virgin coconut oil for only 24 hours had shown results which made me feel blessed!<br /><br />I've been slowly and steadily rectifying a serious magnesium deficiency while searching for what felt like a missing catalyst or synergistic essence which would cause magnesium supplementation to be accepted by the body, and then seated into the cellular level of life enhancing operations.  Dr. Carolyn Dean's book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ODEPY4">The MAGNESIUM MIRACLE</a> is an excellent guide to Magnesium's magic in healing, normalizing, and strengthening the embodied human soul.  I've been thinking that coconut, in its several forms of use, could work as a catalyst for magnesium, while magnesium works as a catalyst for all other nutrients, including coconut oil, to function correctly.  What a team!!<br /><br />To understand the vital message in what I'm trying to say here, please be cajoled or even coerced (jokingly) into reading some of my Amazon.com reviews on magnesium products and the two books linked above... as a start on a journey to understanding, appreciating, and relishing LIFE.  Other great Magnesium and Coconut books and products are available, easily found using search capacities.<br /><br />According to some experts, the most important thing to know about oils, fats, and coconut products is that they should be gently, minimally, and carefully processed by cold pressing, preferably labeled ANH (absolutely no heat used in processing); the reasons for this are detailed in Fife's book.<br /><br />Also according to some experts, the most important thing to know about magnesium is that it needs to be held in highest priority and percentage in the minerals taken into the body, and that certain foods, additives, and supplements can defeat bio-availability of magnesium.  Especially calcium needs to be taken in much lower amounts than magnesium, and in the current food marketplace and general eating habits; calcium is usually assimilated in large quantities, causing illnesses related to calcification or deposits, and contributing to magnesium deficiency.  This situation is detailed in Dr. Dean's book.<br /><br />My main concern with coconut usage for persons like me who are severely deficient in magnesium is that most offerings of coconut I'm aware of hold more potassium than magnesium, which could upset the balance and primary necessity of magnesium.<br /><br />In my non-professional opinion magnesium is the INDEX nutritional substance; the A-Priori for Life.<br /><br />Maybe even the Tree of Life needs magnesium as its priority nutrient...<br /><br />With adequate magnesium held within the cell structures... [some experts say cells need to retain 10,000 times more magnesium than any other mineral]... the body can adequately and correctly utilize other minerals and necessary nutrients, in order to live strong and disease free. [See my review of Dr. Dean's book.]<br /><br />Maybe magnesium seats life, coconut is the cozy catalyst, and taste buds rule!<br /><br />Linda Shelnutt<br /><br />Other excellent coconut oils available on Amazon:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GAT6NG">Nutiva Organic Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 54-Ounce Jar</a><br />[The link above goes to the large size, the one I showed in my review on Bruce Fife's book]<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Q64">Nutiva Organic  Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, 15-Ounce Tubs (Pack of 2)</a> [This is the product used in the video here.  Though the flavor and quality of the EFAGold was slightly better, of the bottles I've used so far, I will happily and thankfully continue to purchase all three of these products, for various reasons favoring each.]
