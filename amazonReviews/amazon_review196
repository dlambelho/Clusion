This is the worst body wash I have ever used and I have used a few (from most regular mass market products like Axe, Old Spice to designer brands like Armani, Dunhill). The things that I expect from a bodywash/shower gel are:<br /><br />1) It should clean you very well and leave you feeling fresh (BUT while doing so it should not dry your skin). In the long run it should be good for the skin.<br /><br />2) It should not have any ingredient which is harmful for the skin. Specifically I avoid the following like plague: Petrolatum, Parben, Mineral Oil (apart from these, I also try to avoid SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate) but it is hard to find a body wash or shower gel without SLS - its pervasive).<br /><br />3) Have a good soothing or invigorating fragrance (while not being so strong as to cause a headache)<br /><br />Before beginning this review let me tell you why I avoid the ingredients Petrolatum, Parben and Mineral Oil - all these ingredients, in the name of 'moisturizing your skin by locking in vital moisture' actually form a sheath on top of your skin and clog its pores. This is extremely unhealthy for the skin since skin, for being healthy, needs to be able to breathe freely for expelling impurities out of the system. The implication of using products (body washes, shower gels) with these ingredients is that you do not feel as fresh after the shower (compared to products  without these ingredients) since your skin pores are clogged and suffocated. Though I noticed that this Dove Men + Care Clean Comfort Body Wash contained Petrolatum (and SLS), I wanted to give it a try since I hold in high regard Unilever in general for their well engineered products and the Dove brand in particular for their moisturizing bar soap which is one of the best soaps for skin and is a fantastic product.<br /><br />However I was shocked when I used this. It is the worst of all worlds - This body wash almost does not clean you at all but leaves such a heavy residue on your skin that you will feel horrible - as if you did not have a shower at all. And dare you use this when you are a little more unclean than usual - when you come out of the shower you will wonder whether you had a shower at all. There is absolutely NO feeling of freshness OR cleanliness that you expect from a shower. Now some might argue that usually 'moisturizing' body washes are intended more to moisturize than to leave you feeling squeaky clean - well I'm not talking of anything even close to squeaky clean here - when you have a bath (even if it were with the world's most moisturizing soap/body wash) you expect to feel a minimal level of freshness (otherwise there is no point of a bath - you might as well smother yourself with moisturizing lotion instead).<br /><br />Ok - so this does a horrible job of cleaning. So what about its claims of moisturizing ? The only thing this body wash does is clog your pores and leave your skin feeling suffocated - not supple and well cared for. So if you have an oily skin or if you are a little stale from perspiration and get into the shower with this, you will feel horrible since this will 1) not clean you in any way 2) lock in the dirt that you had before the shower - can you imagine how bad that can feel ? I wonder whether this product was well tested on actual people (which is a basic requirement and the norm with any cosmetic manufacturer of credibility/repute) before being rolled out.<br /><br />As for the fragrance, its just OK. Nothing that you would look forward to.<br /><br />I'm thoroughly disappointed with Unilever for releasing such a badly engineered and tested product. This is extremely uncharacteristic of this very good FMCG company. I threw this in the bin after using it thrice (I was disgusted after the very first use but wanted to give this a chance just in case the first day was a 'bad bath day' - but alas the bad was not in the day - it was in the gel).<br /><br />Well this review was a passionate one and so could come across to some as bordering on the weird - for after all its a body wash isn't it ? Your life does not depend on it. But well, I am very particular about the decisions I make for my health, grooming and well being. This product was so horrible that it disgusted me to the extent necessary to elicit such strong feelings of dislike and disapproval. However, as I always suggest, do not take my word for it - try this yourself (if you want) with an open mind but at the same time being conscious of what to test/look for after reading this review - because after all you are the best judge of what suits you and what is good for you. Also, I strongly suggest that you try to find a cleaning product without SLS (Sodium Lauryl Sulfate/ Sodium Laureth Sulfate), since SLS penetrates the skin and even the internal organs easily and can cause havoc like endocrinological imbalances, neurological disorders, organ toxicity and cancer on long term use.
