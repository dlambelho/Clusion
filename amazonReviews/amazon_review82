I first tried this product, Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce, in a 10-inch tortilla wrap rolled with baby swiss cheese and extra-thin slices of roast beef.  I thought it added fine notes of flavors, and I would use it again for this exact purpose.  I like most of the flavors and textures this sauce brings.<br /><br />PROBLEM<br /><br />But I don't detect much jalape&ntilde;o flavor, which is one of my favorites, and which is why I chose this to begin with.<br /><br />===== Which is why I subtract ONE STAR.<br /><br />SOLUTION<br /><br />Using the nearest blade, I simply chopped up a few slices from a jar of jalape&ntilde;os (using the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00093090Y">Victorinox 47547 10-1/4-Inch Wavy Bread Knife, Black Fibrox Handle</a>), dumped them and a little bit of the jar's juice into the bottle, and gave it a pretty sincere shaking.  Voila.<br /><br />I ordered this product rather than some similar one for a secondary purpose, which is to make the following point, which I insist you not only read carefully but also find interesting.<br /><br />As you know, the word jalape&ntilde;os is properly pronounced as follows:<br /><br />hall aah PAY nyos.  But I have heard it pronounced, and you might too, as follows:<br /><br />jal uh PEE nuhz.<br /><br />This is a remarkably poor pronunciation, and I think it might set some sort of record for the greatest density of mistakes.<br /><br />1.  It's h, not j.<br />2.  It's all, not Al.<br />3.  It's aah, not uh.<br />4.  It's pay, not pee.<br />5.  It's ny, not n.<br />6.  It's os, not us.<br />7.  And it's os, not ohz.<br /><br />That's nearly 2 mistakes per syllable, or one every 1.3 letters in only 9 letters.  Can you think of a word that is more severely mispronounced?<br /><br />===== For this I subtract TWO MORE STARS from the product.<br /><br />Although it is not my choice as a substitute for picante sauce on a taco or pretty much any Mexican food, that's just my personal preference.  It does make a striking salad dressing, and it can be used as a base for a dipping sauce for tortillo chips or the like.  And I like a little mixed into mashed potatoes or a topping for a baked potato, but again that's just me.<br /><br />I tried other applications just for this Amazon review, and here are the results.<br /><br />-- Drizzled onto a pumpkin pie<br /><br />This turned out to be just awful.  The flavors of a well-made pumpkin pie are not only not enhanced by the addition of this sauce on top of it, they are positively worsened, especially when compared to the use of a substance such as, say, whipped cream.  If you are thinking of duplicating this test just to make sure I'm not merely making this up, I recommend that you drizzle the sauce onto the top of a single slice and not the whole entire pumpkin pie as I did, just in case you get the same result and wish you hadn't.<br /><br />-- As a substitute for vermouth in a classic straight-up gin martini<br /><br />This result also was ghastly.  Whoever perfected the first classic martini did a good thing for the dlrow of people who like the classic martini, or the fourth one, as the case may be in your time zone.  Whoever thought of using Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce instead of vermouth made, in my opinion, a grievous mistake.  Another griebous mistake is to make a whole batch of martinish this way instead of just one.  Live and learn, though, right?<br /><br />-- Sunblock<br /><br />This is a closer call, so let me list the pros and the cons.  The best argument in favor of using this sauce as a substitute for any of the regular, purpose-made sunblock lotions that are approved by The United States FDA and are available in many convenient stores is that it does work in the sense that whereever you have it slathered on thick enough, it will surely reduce the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet-range radiation on your skin, I would think, to some extent or other.  I am not inclined to test the exact SPF value of this sauce under the many exact various circumstances such as Hawaii unless YUM Brands wants to fund the research!<br /><br />As a sunblock Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o Sauce does suffer from a number of problems.  One is that it slides off of pretty much any part of you that isn't bowl-shaped or at least flat and horizontal in your particular bodily configuration when it's applied.  For example, if you're lying supine you can pop open the top, which is handily hinged, and squeeze out some of this particular sauce (I have the eight-ounce size) into your navel and have a fair chance it will provide some degree or other of protection to the skin thereunder, assuming you have an innie.<br /><br />Another drawback is that no one -- at least no one I asked over a period of dozens of hours spread out over several weeks at various pools and beaches this summer -- seems to want to help you apply this exact sauce to your back.<br /><br />A third con to this optional sunblock use is that in the hot sun this sauce reeks out a noisome aroma within a three-foot radius that is not only not nearly as pleasant as the reminiscigential smell of suntan lotion, it is decidedly worse than neutral.  In fact, I think I'd rather smell three feet.<br /><br />I don't know about you, but when I balance the pros and the cons I weigh the sunblock cons more heavily.<br /><br />===== So, because of its failure as a substitute for whipped cream and vermouth and sunblock lotion, I subtract YET 1 MORE STAR.<br /><br />SUMMARY<br /><br />If you like a little jalape&ntilde;o flavor in this type of sauce, buy this product.  If you like more, you can add it.
