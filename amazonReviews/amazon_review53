Another reviewer comments on 50g of chicken/beef vs. hemp being a better protein serving.<br /><br />For poop and chuckles, 50 grams of chicken breast contains 14.5 grams of the chicken's protein. Then, he is right; he is ingesting more protein if he eats hemp with 20 grams. But due to the high quality of the chicken (roasted) breast at 136, I'd much rather get that 14.5 grams of chicken protein if my health depended upon it, instead of the 20 grams of hemp protein.<br /><br />!!! hemp protein is very weak in lysine and somewhat in tryptophan (according to the amino acid data Nutiva, this manufacturer, provides on their website after it is studied more than their presentation allows at face value -since it lists numbers but not human optimal requirements), only 55% of the ideal ratio of lysine to overall protein if I did this back of the envelope calc correctly, and both of these two essential amino acids are lacking.  That would give it around a protein quality of 55 when we are looking for over 100 in that measure. Normally protein quality is nothing to worry about since randomly several sources are combined and usually work out well.  But some people seem to really push their protein intake very high for bulking up, etc., and others, usually not healthy are trying to supplement their needs to meet their numbers.  In both of those cases protein quality will make or break their strategy.  That is not to say they need to have complete proteins each time they eat: Only; they need to approximate optimal human essential amino acid proportions basically over a day or so.<br /><br />Chicken, on the other hand, has a protein quality score of 136, almost reaching egg whites (145), and exceeding, soy and most other proteins, making it a much better quality protein - and he is correct in not getting caught up in the "grams". Then, there was a PhD student commenting on bioavailability of hemp protein and plant protein in general. He also is right and hemp's nutritional value can be overestimated by not looking at this. A good assumption for veggies is about 80% BV for veggie products compared to chicken, so that makes hemp worse than the 55 ...<br /><br />All the above said, hemp is great, you just need to quantify what you are getting and tailor it to your needs. The feeling of being "full" has nothing to do with the quantity of protein as the other reviewer claimed he felt. As a matter of fact, fresh veggies are low in protein and people eat them to feel full - old dieting trick.<br /><br />SUGGESTION: The bottom line is if you are in need of protein supplementation, be careful with counting on large amounts of hemp if you haven't complemented the relatively "low protein quality" with other "low quality" proteins to get the correct mix for optimal diet needs... it would be critical to add 100g of frozen spinach and a cob of corn or its equivalent in kernels to get the additional lysine and tryptophan per serving of hemp - it would be a reasonable vegetable source if you go the vegetarian route.<br /><br />But, hemp protein still has other amino acids below 100, so you are improving the two weakest points with a nutrient dense food like spinach to balance it out. I haven't checked the rest - and now it is time to say "eat a well balanced diet". Yogurt or whey protein will take care of that - combining it with hemp protein content 1:1; soy somewhat if you are vegan - but be careful of not overdoing it for your thyroid hormone with soy ... find some extracted with alcohol if this is the case since the pseudo hormones are diminished in the  alcohol extraction. Don't ask me where to buy it but it is out there.<br /><br />Soy is great in moderation and offers better quality than hemp. As for eating too much protein in general, this can be a problem, too if you get supplemented out, especially if the amino acid profile is not a good match for optimal nutrition conveniently found in meat, dairy and soy proteins. The excess amino acids are disposed of by stressing the liver in extreme cases (somewhere over 1.2 grams protein per pound of body weight depending on the strength of your liver). So, if you eat an average protein quality of 55 and get your daily grams, you will actually only get let's estimate something of the order of 55% of that protein incorporated into you (ok, there is a bit more to it depending on the non-essentials, but this is the general idea) and the rest will be dumped into your liver, excreted and converted into energy. The excretion part will be in the form of urea. Too much urea in the urine puts you at risk for gout a disease you don't want to know about.<br /><br />So, best to eat a serving of spinach and cob of corn with a 30 gram serving of this hemp, beans and Swiss chard would be helpful, but really a well balanced diet including dairy is the healthy low risk situation keeping a general eye on fats but no dwelling on it to the point of worrying about gaining an ounce of weight every now and then ... that's why we need to exercise. People who are immobile have other issues and the bioavailability, supplementation and protein quality are very important. Like for preventing skin breakdown and bed sores to start with. Depends on your situation.<br /><br />As a final note ... this hemp protein extract 50% powder (be sure to understand when you order which you are getting) goes better with smoothies unless you like eating a woody taste, but still has lots of fiber so just hope you acquire the taste.  Hope this helps...<br /><br />*This makes sense if that reviewer is comparing it to his 20 grams content of protein (40g hemp powder) of whatever he serves himself. If so (and it seems that way from the ambiguous talk of grams, serving size and exactly what is being measured), he is comparing 20 grams of hemp protein to the protein content in a 50 gram portion of chicken breast (who knows - maybe he means 50 grams chicken protein which would be a lot more chicken breast to eat and lots more protein).
