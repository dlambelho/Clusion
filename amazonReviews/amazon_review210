During the cat food recalls of 2007, I became aware that the dry food I always fed my cats was not a good diet. In fact - at the time - I prided myself on feeding cats @ $8.00 a month.  Luckily, this Generic was not using the Gluten that was the cause of the Recalls.  After trying various tastes, my budget and cats decided on Holistic (use to be Eagle Pack Holistic) Chicken dry and Wellness Chicken Grain Free.<br /><br />Then, we had a problem with the Wellness Canned Cat Food Recently (it was pulled from Amazon - and now my Canned Chicken food doesn't show up in a review).  I then went to the Wellpet site, and noticed mostly dry food was offered from many online retailers.  THIS told me something was afoot - and I went back to the forum which helped me with cat food research.  Unfortunately, many folks had gone back to fish as a main part of their cats food.  However, they did bring up the rotation aspect - this means never feeding the same type of cat food concurrently, and also picking up some locally first, to make sure your cats will eat the darn thing.<br /><br />Locally, Chicken was the least affected of the Wellness foods, and the store I get it from, Wellness is manufactured at ANI (code begins MW).  This means I could also get a food that was produced at Menu/Simmons.  However, Weruva was raved about in the forums, so without knowing where it was manufactured - I gave a few cans a shot (Green Eggs & Chicken was the first flavor I read - so that is what I tried).  All cats slopped that food right up with no ill effects (Siberia is a 13 yo with sensi tummy issues, and there were none with this food - even after he gulped it up).<br /><br />I then looked up Weruva on the Internet, and found out it was manufactured in Thailand.  This first gave me pause, but they do guarantee Human Grade Food, and the food in the cans look quite edible (and no, I'm not eating it - but in an emergency ;-).<br /><br />Amazon has a better deal on this food than my local retailer. So my order for the cans went in (I had read some negative reviews here about the quality of the food, but with the Amazon Guarantee - how can you go wrong?)  I am pleased to announce that the food received from Amazon looked and tasted (according to the cats), as good as that purchased locally.  So for Weruva, Amazon has my business.<br /><br />With rotation, you can circumvent the cost of Weruva in a multi-cat household, AND being on a fixed income, through rotating.  I've settled on four canned food varieties, and one dry food (I may also be inclined to try some Weruva Paw Licken' Chicken, but for now - I have plenty of food).  The cost for multi-cat households is also offset by buying the larger canned varieties - 12.5oz to 13oz, and learning how to store them in the Refrigerator.<br /><br />On Amazon, I recommend the following:<br /><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TM70WY">Weruva Green Eggs & Chicken Cat Food, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />Wellness Adult Turkey Canned Cat Food (I prefer the Chicken, but until it reappears, this will do just as well).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WFMCCM">Felidae Canned Cat Food for Adult Cats and Kittens, Chicken and Rice Formula in Chicken Broth (Pack of 12 13 Ounce Cans)</a> (Its not grain free, but I personally don't like the mix for the regular, and neither do my cats).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F74248">Innova Cat and Kitten Formula Canned Cat Food</a> (I had used it in 2007, and decided it wouldn't hurt them in a rotation.  Its the only wet food that contains some fish).<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a> (I have tried to go all wet, but Baby Girl - 17, has had problems with all Grain Free, so a little dry didn't hurt her).<br /><br />I feed a little dry first thing in morning every day.  Then 1/2 can of one flavor, remainder placed in refrig plastic lid.  Then 1/2 can of another flavor, same storage.  The next day, those cans are used up by adding a little hot water and nuking from 5 to 8 secs (this depends on your microwave and amount of food).  The next day, we have 5.5 oz can of Weruva split between 3 cats, and 1/2 can of the last flavor.  The next day we have another 5.5 oz can, and the remainder of the previous can.  That is four days, fifth day we are back to the beginning.<br /><br />A side note, many supplement with Friskies canned in order to cut costs.  I personally have yet to get over the meat by-product thing.  However, if it would help your budget - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJAOR6">Friskies Cat Food Classic Pate, Turkey & Giblets Dinner, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> is THE best one to use for this purpose (no glutens).<br /><br />3 paws up for Weruva.
