I love Mighty Leaf teas and have found no other teas that can match their quality, taste, and freshness.  However the Bombay Chai falls far below my expectation for an authentic chai tea.  The tea tastes very weak and is lacking the robust black tea taste that a chai tea should have.  The taste created by Bombay Chai departs from the traditional chai tea taste.  In my opinion, this tea cannot even be considered a "chai" tea.  Yes, the spices used are traditional chai spices, however the flavor is not that of chai. After my great experience with other Mighty Leaf teas, I was greatly disappointed with their attempt at a chia tea recipe.<br /><br />Yet in spite of Mighty Leaf Bombay Chai's shortcoming, this tea is still far more healthy and tasty than the boxed chai teas on the market - Oregon Chai and Tazo Chai (sold by Starbucks).  These boxed chai teas are what most Americans consider chai, however they are very far from it.  These boxed chai teas are dessert drinks that are loaded with sugar digest horribly.<br /><br />Chai tea spices are medicinal in nature, supporting the function of different organs and reducing the "dampness" (Chinese Medicine) or "kapha" (Ayurveda Medicine) of the milk used to create a more balanced drink.<br /><br />I have traveled India and tasted authentic chai tea - both in south India and north India (subtly different recipes).  I have even had the pleasure to taste very rare varieties of black tea leaves.  Unfortunately I have never tasted chai tea outside of India that resembles what I have enjoyed in India.  My own experiments with chai spices have created chai tea that is closer than what is sold in America, however there is a uniqueness to chai tea in India that is difficult to replicate.<br /><br />I find that I can create a more authentic chai tea by using Mighty Leaf Organic Breakfast Tea combined with a blend of chai spices (cardamom, cinnamon, ginger and cloves).  Or if I am in a hurry, I skip the spices and use a tea bag of Tulsi Red Chai Masala (caffeine-free Roiboos tea, not black tea).  I find this unique combination of black tea and roiboos a tasty recipe.<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VDP11Y">Organic India Tulsi Red Chai Masala, 18-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001ET5Y0M">Mighty Leaf Tea, Organic Breakfast, Tea Bags, 15-Count Box, Biodegradable Whole Leaf Pouches (Pack of 3)</a><br /><br />-- My Praise for Mighty Leaf Teas ---<br /><br />Mightly Leaf Tea should be considered in a class of it's own for tea. The leaves and herbs used are extremely fresh. When you open a plastic (not paper that breathes) pouch, you are immediately hit with the sweet aroma of fresh tea. I have never smelled another tea bag that even comes close to the freshness. Even most bulk teas are not packaged correctly or quick enough at the manufacturer to keep this much freshness in the tea.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is a bit more expensive than other organic tea, however the quality of the leaves and herbs is the highest. Might Leaf Tea uses large pieces of leaves, herbs, and flowers - unlike most teas that use shreds of leaves. Shredded tea oxidizes very quickly due to the increased surface area. This results in tea that loses flavor and smell very quickly.<br /><br />Mighty leaf uses silk bags which have larger pores than paper bags. This means that the water penetrates the tea bags more fully, allowing the newly tea-infused water to spread to the cup more quickly. Brewing tea too long will create a bitter taste. The problem with most paper tea bags is that infused tea water cannot spread quickly enough through the cup to create a bold, full flavor before the 3-5 brewing time has passed. This means that either your tea is not full flavored or is bitter. Mighty Leaf solves this problem by using silk bags.<br /><br />Each Mighty Leaf Tea bag is sealed in a plastic pouch. Since plastic is less porous than paper, these pouches keep the tea and herbs fresher longer.<br /><br />There is nothing to not like about Mighty Leaf Tea. I only wish that Mighty Leaf Tea started selling Tulsi tea and I would be in Heaven.<br /><br />Mighty Leaf Tea is clearly the creation of tea experts who appreciate the highest quality organic ingredients. They have created a tea bag system that is far beyond what any other company has done. Every type of tea that Mighty Leaf Tea offers tastes incredible. So choose your favorite flavor and enjoy tea as it should be experienced - fresh, bold, and delicious.
