Yet another of my long winded reviews. Beware Ye of little attention and patience.<br /><br />Vinegar has many uses.<br /><br />A surprising and pleasurable use of the simplest white wine vinegar is to use it to soak your feet.<br />Feet which have had an unacceptable odor will become completely neutral in smell.<br />Vinegar is mildly antimicrobial and acidic. It kills the smelly bugs living on your feet and (probably, I'm not a doctor) will also help your body combat a minor cut or wound on the feet.<br />Toenail jam which normally is like cement cleans out easily.<br />The nails on my big toes can normally only be trimmed with a pair of Klein Mechanics' 8" side cutting pliers are cut with the usual nail tools.<br /><br />Here's some of my details:<br /><br />You will need:<br />A comfortable place to sit tight for at least a half hour.<br />1 gallon of any old white vinegar. This may be the hardest task of this project. Surprisingly, even here in Manhattan where all people seem to do is try to get rich trading Derivatives and eat Food, it can be tough to find cheap, large plastic 1 gallon jugs of vinegar. Smaller supermarket chains usually don't stock the big jugs but I've had good luck getting them to bring them in. Getting them on Da Net is possible but the shipping kills you. "Pint's a pound, the world round". Five dollars a gallon, delivered into my apartment, is the best I have been able to do.<br />A tub of some sort which will comfortably allow you to put both feet into. Rubbermaid makes inexpensive new ones which can be bought from Amazon. Minimum 10 - 12 gallons. Don't use some old junk tub as there will be a fair amount of water which can cause damage.<br />A smaller decanter for filling and emptying the tub.<br />A few old towels.<br />A small plastic drop cloth for good wood floors and/or carpeting.<br />Some way to determine the water temperature. A candy thermometer works fine.<br />One clean, dry towel.<br /><br />Procedure:<br />This whole thing is good to do if you have a minimum of an hour where you are parked and going nowhere. I read or do computer work.<br />Plan ahead.<br />Be very safety conscious. If there is any possibility of electricity mixing with water, then do what I do. Raise every electrical wire, splitter, computer etc which is nearby off the floor. Use short pieces of cheap 2 by 4 lumber. The higher off the floor the better. Don't be stupid. Do not ignore my advice. The medical coroner will be amused at your clean, dead feet if you don't. Do not allow this to happen. Don't be stupid. I don't think I can bang on enough about this danger.<br />My white oak flooring was nice when I installed it about 25 years ago but now its got a bunch of stains and I just don't care. If you have nice flooring, put down a little plastic in the area where you will sit. If you are a complete accident prone putz then get a larger tub to hold the smaller one (the one your feet will fit in). Tubs are cheap insurance, especially if you have other tenants living under you.<br />Make sure both tubs can hold the full amount of fluid which is a minimum of 5 gallons.<br />Keep everything you may need handy so that you don't have to go traipsing around with wet feet.<br />Put down some old towels under and around the your tub. There will be some splash when you're done and when you are emptying the tub. The tub will be at least 40 pounds of soiled water. I use a smaller decanter with yet another tub with a handle to empty the whole shebang.<br />Pour your gallon of vinegar into the tub. Room temperature is fine. I believe a minimum  ratio of 1 to 4 (1 gallon vinegar and 4 gallons of water) is fine. I acquired an old mop bucket which holds a fair amount more water. Warm water up past my ankles, very nice. The amount of water is not too important as long as you use 1 gallon of vinegar.<br />Next, you have to determine the highest temperature yo' feets can take. I have a fancy pants Fluke 65 infrared thermometer and 110 degrees (F) is about the limit of what my feet can take. Interesting, my hands tolerate much higher limits.<br />You can do a little experimentation with a simple, cheap candy thermometer to find a high limit.<br />Remember, the temperature of your tub water starts to cool down immediately. I have found it to drop 5 to 10 degrees after a half an hour which is fine.<br />Use the highest temperature you can take.<br />My faucets spews out water at about 150 to 160 degrees (F) so it's easy for me to fill the tub. You may have to heat up some water to get past 110 degrees (F). I recommend no more than 3 gallons (24 pounds) of very hot water for a single person to handle.<br />Unless I'm really bored and/or drinking, a minimum half an hour soak is perfect.<br />Maintenance on stubborn toenails is easy at this point.<br />After a soak, the whole house smells mildly of vinegar. This may or not bother you. Not much different from making a salad dressing.<br />Amazingly, if you dry your feet with a fresh, clean towel, the vinegar smell disappears by time you empty your tub.<br />If you have an ultra sensitive beezer, by all means rinse your feet in the shower.<br />You now have clean and sanitary tootsies, very suitable for further attention of all sorts.<br /><br />BTW, the first time I did all of this, an entire afternoon had disappeared. Now I can do it all in about an hour, once a week or so. It's not a bad idea to sprinkle some fancy, disinfecting foot powder into your stinky shoes every now and then.<br />I know I have droned on with cautions. They're for your safety and my conscience.<br /><br />Enjoy and prosper.
