RECENTLY (Dec 09) found a superior pasta: La Porta! <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002GJL7QO">La Porta Spighetti, 1.1 Pound Bags (Pack of 8)</a>. It costs about the same, but is incomparably better than any other Amazon carries. Try it!! You WILL be spoiled!!<br /><br />This is #10 pasta that cooks in 5 or 6 minutes, or 4 minutes if using for a baked recipe. The origins of this type of pasta are to be sought in the Ligurian territories, in the province of Genoa, in Ciociara, and in the Naples area of Italy. Fedelini is a long thin spaghetti-like pasta, similar to Angel Hair. The best condiments for this pasta are BUTTER based sauces, such as butter and cheese, or melted butter with sage and cheese. Excellent also with egg or fresh raw tomato sauces. Another way to eat Fedelini is in a light broth. In the Naples area, Fedelini is used for preparing oven cooked "Pasticci," (or Pastiche, or Pasticcio.) The word literally means "a medley or potpourri or m&eacute;lange" and refers to a lasagne-like casserole composed of various ingredients (depending of the Region) that is baked and served in firm slices. (recipe follows)<br /><br />PASTICCIO<br /><br />The Pasticcio is made in four stages: Sauce (Meat or White), cook pasta (firm!), assemble, and bake. Its time consuming if you try to do it all in one day and it takes lots of pots. I usually make the sauce either a day or two prior to baking the casserole - or even a week a two ahead and freeze it until needed. Then combine all ingredients, add pats of butter to top, and bake at 350 degrees for ABOUT an hour and a half. When the top is puffed and golden it is done (Watch It!) and then must REST for an hour or two prior to cutting in squares and serving. You will need a deep pan like a lasagna pan for baking the pasticcio.<br /><br />Main Ingredients:<br />1 lb. Fedelini<br />1/2 lb. Grated Parmagiano Reggiano Cheese (Imported Italian)<br />1/2 lb. Grated Italian Romano Cheese (or Greek Mizithra Cheese)<br />Grated fresh nutmeg to taste<br />6 eggs<br />salt to taste (start with 1/2 tsp since the cheeses are salty)<br />2 tbsp. unsalted butter for greasing baking pan<br /><br />MEAT SAUCE:<br />One batch Marinara Sauce with Meat<br /><br />WHITE SAUCE:<br />6 heaping tbsp. flour<br />6 tbsp. unsalted butter<br />3 cups 2% milk<br />white pepper to taste<br />grated nutmeg to taste<br />6 slightly beaten eggs (in a bowl)<br />half cube unsalted butter in cubes (for top)<br /><br />If you want a thicker topping, you can increase flour and butter to 8 tablespoons each and add 4 cups of milk for the white sauce. Rest of instructions would be the same.<br /><br />Boil Fedelini in salted water for 4 minutes, drain and return to pot, with heat OFF. Sprinkle in two grated cheeses to taste, about 3/4 of a cup of each cheese. Grate nutmeg to taste into pot and stir all with wooden spoon. Crack eggs into pot quickly one at a time and stir in after each addition. Macaroni will be warm and eggs will seem to cook somewhat but don't worry about it.<br /><br />Assembly of Pasticcio:<br /><br />Heat sauce. Butter baking pan and lay in a couple of large spoonfuls of the sauce. Then take half of the pasta mixture and layer on top of the sauce pressing it down into sauce, and adding sprinklings of both types of grated cheese. REPEAT process, making three or four layers of Fedelini. Finally, layer rest of sauce and sprinkle rest of the cheese on top. Smooth with spoon. Add pats of butter to top.<br /><br />At this point, pan can be covered with plastic wrap and refrigerated for baking the next day. Casserole should be removed from the refrigerator about an hour and a half prior to baking, so it can come to room temperature.<br /><br />White Sauce Preparation and Baking:<br /><br />Preheat oven to 350 degrees.<br /><br />Melt butter in 3 quart heavy stainless steel saucepan. Add flour and mix together with butter using a wire whisk in order to make a rue. Cook for a few minutes over medium high heat to make sure flour loses it's raw taste. (Flour will brown slightly.) While stirring, slowly add milk, and keep stirring so no lumps will form. Still stirring, and add spices. Stir until mixture comes to a full rolling boil. (Must stay on top of this, stirring, so sauce will not burn on the bottom.) Remove from heat.<br /><br />In the bowl with the slightly beaten eggs, begin slowly adding a spoonful of the white sauce in order to temper the eggs, mixing well. Keep adding white sauce, a spoon at a time, and stirring until you have added about a cup of white sauce. Then return all of this mixture into the rest of the white sauce, stirring all the while, to make a smooth sauce before turning on the heat. Heat very briefly and stir until thick and smooth. Remove from heat.<br /><br />(Assemble casserole as above.)<br /><br />Place in preheated oven and bake for about an hour and a half, depending on oven. Keep checking! Pasticcio is done when it is puffed and golden. Cool for 1 hour, slice in squares, remove with a spatula and serve. Or cover with foil and cut a little later. Can wait for an hour or two prior to serving.
