March 2012 - In 2011, when StarBucks broke away from Tassimo Bosch over a contractual dispute, I was completely disappointed, and wondered what other Options were going to be available, in the meantime, I purchased a warehouse supply of StarBuck's Coffee & Cappuccino and started searching for a New Coffee Machine, and then ... in November, I found out that Starbucks was offering the "K-Cup" Version, for the Keurig Coffee machines, and the on-line Reviews for this model were all 4-Star or better. I ordered and received a Brand New B145 OfficePRO model, a supposedly 'Heavy-Duty' unit ... for offices and heavy-duty use.<br /><br />In January, I started to put the Keurig thru it's paces, along-side the Tassimo, and frankly the Tassimo is still SUPERIOR, in the way that it Brews for Better Flavor, has a Faster Brewing Cycle, and heats the H2O to the Optimal Temperature, than the Keurig, which BTW, is/was a lot NOSIER than the Tassimo. In all fairness, this could be  a 'technical' problem with the Bar Code settings on the K-Cups. Note , that I continued to also use my Red Tassimo unit, as it is/was the only coffee unit to use the Milk Creamers, as Keurig still does not offer that option, anywhere!<br /><br />In February, I left on a 3-week trip, and as I always do, I turned off all the unnecessary electric Household appliances, and took off.<br />When I returned back this month of March, I was so PISSED to find out that the Brand New Keurig was totally INOPERABLE!<br />Nada! Zip! Zero! Despite, doing everything that was Recommended on Forums (don't go the Keurig Forums, as they are so Worthless!)<br />Right now, I have a large, fancy Keurig BRICK that I am attempting to get a Refund for, so stay tuned!<br /><br />Comparison of the Keurig OfficePRO versus the Tassimo Bosch:<br /><br />* Start-up Time: Tassimo Win's, as it starts to Brew immediately after you turn it on! Keurig has a 'Warm-Up Phase, until an Indicator light's up, to let you know that it's ready to brew.<br /><br />* Brewing Time: Tassimo Win's, as it's a bit Faster, regardless of the Size of the T-disc, and because you literally have no "start-up" time.<br />So Logically, this will play a factor in the Brewing Time, as well. In fairness, we are talking about a 2 to 3-minute gap, that this could be interpreted as being a bit too Subjective, but, that's how I roll ...<br /><br />* Brew Strength: Tassimo Win's again! I tested a Medium StarBuck's T-disc Grind, versus a Medium StarBuck's K-Cup. The Keurig's strength was more like MILD, than Medium.<br /><br />* Unit Noise: Tassimo is significantly quieter than the Keurig unit, by a factor of at least 3!<br /><br />* Water Capacity: Tassimo has 67-ounce removable water tank (without water filter) and accepts MAVEA water filters;<br />The Keurig B145 Water reservoir holds up to 48-ounces. Tassimo Win's!<br /><br />About the UIF (User Interface) and other features, worth mentioning:<br /><br />* Tassimo - On the Front Faceplate, it has 1 Large 'Chrome Button Wheel', that handles all Functions + an On/Off switch. Keurig - Has 5 controls on the Slant Top/Front aspect and 1 large one in the rear with two functions (brew and for drain).<br />* Tassimo - Has a "Add + Cup Feature" to adjust for a larger Size cup, that is available only during the brewing cycle.<br />* Keurig - Has a built-in Selector for 6, 8 and 10 ounce cups.<br />* Keurig - Has optional "Automatic shut-off" button. Tassimo does not, although I found myself turning off the Keurig, as the Automatic shut-off timer has a long LAG time.<br />* Both have a Removable drip tray for travel mug use. The Tassimo has an Adjustable Cup Platform for Smaller cups, AND can be removed for Taller 10 to 12 ounce cups, as well as, for Cleaning.<br />* Size: The Tassimo > W 8" x H 11" x D 13, at 9 pounds; Keurig larger footprint at about 18 pounds.<br />* WARRANTY: Tassimo > 1-year parts-and-labor warranty; Keurig > 30 DAYS! I just found out!!!!<br />* Disclaimer: Tassimo > No; Keurig > Yes!<br /><br />At it's best showing, those few weeks, the Keurig OfficePRO would have received only an overall 2.5 star rating.<br /><br />Postmortem - I was hoping that the Keurig would eventually replace my Little Red Tassimo Engine That Could ... however, now, I find myself with a Nice, Shiny, Noisy BRICK, that I'm trying to return and get my money back. If not I will sell it for Parts!<br />Meanwhile, The Little Red Tassimo Engine That Could ... Keeps Chugging along ...<br /><br />* Update - Just read the GREAT NEWS that StarBucks is releasing their own CONSUMER Model of a Coffee/Cappuccino Maker this Fall !!!<br /><br />Stay Tuned!
