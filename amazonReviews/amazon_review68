YAY!! A 5 lb Havahart Critter Ridder is not available in my area, only the 3 lb one and it isn't even sufficient! But let me tell you this ... I am just so looking forward to receive this 5 lb Havahart Critter Ridder! WHY? I am so tird of having to buy 2 or 3 - 3 lbs if they are available (and it hasn't been for awhile) just one for the front and one for the back yard!<br /><br />THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE TROPIC ZONE AREAS: (By reason of frequent Thunderstorms / Rains)<br /><br />* Wear your lawn or work gloves, sprinkle up in front (I learned this the hard way) in a scattered motion in areas in the front. Areas you know where stray dogs and dog walkers (especially owners who do not pick up after their dog's business) you know that the dog does his/her business, you will sprinkle a little more than usual without dumping the whole entire bottle.<br /><br />* Garbage Can areas - where Coyotes to Wolves and even Foxes and Monkeys raid into them - sprinkle behind the location is sufficient especially helpful if it is in a covered area and lightly in the front (usually where it is going to get wet anyway and the need to re-sprinkle it later). If you have your wife's panty hose that has a hole in it, use the good area, tie a knot on one end and a knot on the other after sprinkling some Havahart Critter Ridder inside. (If you don't have a wife, you can often find them in thrift stores or buy some on Amazon) On the lid inside,  one end and using a fishing line and poking a hole (depending on what type of garbage can lid you might have; or you might have to drill a tiny hole first ... then thread it with a fishing line to two ends. Now you can safely attach the Havahart Critter Ridder inside of your lid of your garbage can which will definitely will can those creatures that opens it for good! (Replinishing it will not be difficult at all)<br /><br />* Veggies to Fruit Trees - be very careful of how much you sprinkle around them for some of the chemicals you place for the plant (fertilizer to feed) contains some repellants themselves. I had found a more effective way to get rid of them due to frequent rains was the same method to get rid of slugs (beer on a lid) - so SAVE THAT CAP to even sardine tin cans. Placing them around after putting Havahart Critter Ridder sprinkles in the clean lid to tin can; the smell itself will drive them away. Even up in the tree itself and what makes it so wonderful is they are out of sight and you are the only one that knows where they are!<br /> - Fruit Rats can't stand it<br /> - The GOOD snakes merely ignores it while BAD SNAKES goes away<br />  except the danged cottonmouth and rattlers after they had a taste<br />  of this.<br /> - 'Coons - "hasta la bye bye"; once they hit your yard, they do not<br />  forget!<br /> - 'Road Kill Casseroles' aka "Possums" - it is a 50/50 coin toss<br />  on this one, young ones always seem to walk right over it (if you<br />  did what I did or sprinkled it on your garden) but larger ones<br />  including as big as a huge housecats notice it and will turn away<br /> - Squirrels - are Squirrels - so the saying goes "where there's a<br />  will, there's a way" ... we've all had our battles to our wit's<br />  end with them! It does work with younger ones, but older ones are<br />  "none the wiser".  :-/<br /> - "Tom Cats" (Strays or Roaming free Cats) - especially those who<br />  likes to mark their territory (P.U.) and not just dig and all that<br />  those tin cans I use works very well - they can't stand the smell<br />  of it and go somewhere else.<br /> - Moneky See, Monkey Smell - Monkey not like!<br /> - Deer - we get them once in a blue moon, but they just graze on<br />  and move on as they spook very easily<br /> - Foxes - they will appear if they are very hungry, but it's your<br />  garbage or trash can they're after.<br /> - Coyotes to Wolves - same as Foxes, they are not shy, and will go<br />  after anything, even your dog's dog food you've left out for your<br />  dog to garbage (trash) can - daylight or night time. This Havahart<br />  really is effective on them<br /> - Florida Panthers and Hybrids - no effect, when they are hungry,<br />  they are going to raid your garbage can anyway but very quick at<br />  it, take what they want and run off with it.<br /> - Bobcats - while rare here, they do appear once in a blue moon and<br />  behaves just like the Florida Panther and the Hybrids.<br /> - Peacocks / Peahens / Peachicks - just cannot stand it (Havahart)<br />  and are the only birds that are sensitive to it that which I love<br />  so much but one has to give or take - because these birds are just<br />  as destructive as other rodents, critters, and animals.<br />SPECIAL NOTE:<br /> - WILL NOT WORK ON RABIED ANIMAL OF ANY SORT - IF YOU SEE ONE, CALL<br />  IMMEDIATELY PER YOUR COUNTY'S ORDINANCE OR 911 SO THEY CAN CAPTURE<br />  SUCH SAID ANIMAL OR CRITTER. Do not make any attempts to make<br />  contact with animal; and bring all your pets and children inside<br />  IMMEDIATELY and keep track of such said animal at all times while<br />  on phone.<br /><br />==============================================================<br /><br />I have for awhile literally BEGGED major Stores to restock this but they say "demand is low", I find this a bunch of garbage; however, I never knew they came in larger sizes (outside of 3 lb).<br /><br />The BAD SIDE is - once it gets wet, you have to reapply - if you opt to use the same method as I do, due to the Tropical Zone and its weather; which is a wise move - make sure the lid to tin can is dry first before applying sprinkles.<br /><br />In my humble opinion .... it would be NICE if Havahart Critter Ridder would last after several thunderstorms / rain which would spare us a lot of trouble here.
