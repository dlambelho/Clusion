I wrote a review of this product detailing my own experience with this product and coconut oil in general. It generated a good discussion spanning 97 comments, however it was not very concise and I wished I had made my points more clearly. This is a rewrite of my initial review.<br /><br />I purchased this product because I had heard stories in the popular media about how coconut oil contains a healthy form of saturated fat. I welcomed this news because coconut oil is a fun ingredient. It has a high smoke point, a great taste, and does not go rancid.<br /><br />As a chemist, the hypothesis for why it may be healthier made sense to me. Coconut oil contains medium chain saturated fats, which differ from the long chain saturated fats found in red meat. I studied lipid transport during my PhD and I think it is totally possible the body does different things with these two different chemicals.<br /><br />However it is also totally possible that the two types of saturated fat both increase one's risk of cardiovascular disease. To figure this out, I looked through the literature and spoke with people to see what proof there was.<br /><br />What I found was that the arguments that suggest medium chain saturated fats are health appeared flawed to me. Here are the arguments I have heard:<br /><br />Some people reference studies of island dwelling-people who eat diets rich in coconut fats. These people have low rates of heart disease. The problems with these studies are significant. First, these people often die earlier than Westerners, and that is why they have lower cardiovascular disease. They have lower rates of Alzheimer's disease too. This is because of the second, larger problem: there are MANY things about the life of an island-dwelling person that is different than that of a Westerner. Maybe the diet is the cause of an observed effect, maybe it is the increased exercise or different sleep pattern. You just can't draw conclusions when so many variables have changed. Islanders are just too different to use as a model.<br /><br />Some people trust books written about the subject like "The Coconut Oil Miracle" or "The Healing Miracle of Coconut Oil". The problem with these books is that they are books, not studies. To prove something, you have to perform a study. To make their arguments, they often cite studies, but the studies are like the one above, typically flawed. There isn't a paper published that shows medium chain saturated fats do not increase the risk of cardiovascular disease the way saturated fats do.<br /><br />There have also been citations from doctors such as Dr. Mercola. It is best to take advice from leaders in the field, rather than doctors trying to sell a book or treatement. Specifically Dr. Mercola has been admonished by the FDA for making misleading claims:  [...] Be careful who you trust.<br /><br />Ultimately, there is no evidence that medium chain saturated fats have different health effects than saturated fats. The most convincing argument in favor of coconut oil is that saturated fats themselves are not dangerous. There is controversy on this subject (just like with most medical subjects) but the vast majority of the data supports the idea that saturated fat increases your risk of cardiovascular disease. To support this, here are some sources.<br /><br />1) Harvard University School of Public Health published this easy guide to fats and cholesterol:<br />[...]<br />Here they recommend that you should not decrease fat intake overall, just replace saturated fats with unsaturated, the less saturated the better.<br />2) The most convincing paper on this subject says this:<br />"Based on consistent evidence from human studies, replacing saturated fat with polyunsaturated fat modestly lowers coronary heart disease risk, with ~10% risk reduction for a 5% energy substitution; whereas replacing saturated fat with carbohydrate has no benefit and replacing saturated fat with monounsaturated fat has uncertain effects. "<br /> To restate this, if you replace saturated fat with polysaturated fat, you will reduce your risk of heard disease. The authors say a 10% risk reduction is modest, but consider that you are most likely to die for a heart attack so a 10% risk reduction is quite welcome in my opinion.<br />Further research has shown "The meta-analysis of the trials showed that increasing polyunsaturated fat consumption as a replacement for saturated fat reduced the risk of coronary heart disease events by 19%." That is a huge effect.<br />Citation is here:<br />Lipids. 2010 Oct;45(10):893-905. Epub 2010 Mar 31.<br />Saturated fat and cardiometabolic risk factors, coronary heart disease, stroke, and diabetes: a fresh look at the evidence.<br />Micha R, Mozaffarian D.<br />Department of Epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA 02115, USA.<br />3) Finally here is a list of all the studies done on the subject, what you will find is that, while the topic is controversial, it is not a 50/50 toss-up. The majority of studies find saturated fat to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.<br />[...]<br /><br />To summarize what I learned from these conversations and articles, I now know that there is no proof that medium chain saturated fats behave differently than long chain saturated fats, and I know saturated fats likely increase your risk of cardiovascular disease as much as 19%.<br /><br />I decided to take the more conservative path and I sold the coconut oil I bought, hopefully to someone who plans on using it in some other way besides eating it. I hope to realize the health benefits associated with replacing saturated fats in my diet with polyunsaturated fats.
