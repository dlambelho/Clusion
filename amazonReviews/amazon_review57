WHAT IS BEEF RENDANG?<br /><br />Beef Rendang, or Daging Rendang in bahasa, is a "dry curry" from Sumatra, Indonesia. It may be popular in Singapore, but they did not invent it. According to wikipedia, the Minangkabau migrated from Sumatra to the Malay peninsula, bringing this recipe with them, and now it is popular all the way up into southern Thailand. If you have never had it, the flavors are reminiscent of a Thai curry, especially Masaman curry, which wikipedia says is a Thai version of a Sumatran recipe, quite likely this one. In fact, the name "Masaman" could well be derived from "Muslim".<br /><br />While this dish can be called a curry, it won't taste like anything you'll find in most Indian restaurants. It has some of the same ingredients as South India, and a number of others that are more commonly used in Southeast Asia. The dish is called "dry" because the practice is to cook it down until the sauce no longer flows, instead clinging to the chunks of meat.<br /><br />YOU COULD MAKE IT FROM SCRATCH...<br /><br />Beef rendang is a reasonably easy dish to make from scratch - IF you have access to the ingredients. Cities like Boston, New York, and many others have groceries that carry things like fresh lemongrass, galanga, kaffir lime leaf, pandan leaf, and palm sugar. There is a wealth of recipes available on the Web by searching for "rendang recipe" (without quotes), and with a modest amount of prep time, you could easily do this from scratch and make something that tastes very close to what your average Indonesian cook would make. That is, it would be "authentic," whatever that means.<br /><br />...BUT YOU BUY THIS MIX IS FOR CONVENIENCE.<br /><br />But maybe you don't have access to the ingredients. Maybe you don't want to take the time to mince all the various ingredients into a spice paste. Or make coconut milk from a whole coconut (something few people do these days, anyway). But you still like the spicy and unique flavor, or just want to try something new.<br /><br />This mix has two envelopes inside. One is a pre-made spice paste mix that has most of the strong flavors. The other is a powdered coconut milk. Buy some beef, and with some water and vegetable oil, and this mix, you're in business.<br /><br />COMMENTS ON THE PREPARATION<br /><br />The recipe is an odd translation from Singaporean measurements. It tells you to buy 28 ounces of beef tenderloin, but then tells you to cut it into pieces 1 cm thick, and requires 4/5 cup of water, measures that are uncommon in an American kitchen. So here is MY version of the recipe, which is basically what is on the box but with some adjustments to the directions, not just the measurements, but also the procedure.<br /><br />Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces, a bit less than 1/2" thick, but it is not critical. Fry it in a wide pan or a wok in some vegetable oil (they say 2 1/2 Tbsp) until it is brown all over. I found that in doing this, there was a fair amount of water in the wok that came from the beef while it was cooking.<br /><br />Now mix in the rendang paste. When you open the coconut milk powder envelope, and you'll see that it has lumps. The easiest path to a smooth sauce is to put it into a sieve or use a strainer with a spoon, shaking the dust and crushing the lumps until it all goes through. The water needed is close to 3/4 cup, but I suggest you start with about half of that, and add more later only if you need to. Stir it well.<br /><br />The package says to cook to the desired doneness. If you want it authentic, you'll need to cook it for a good while, especially if you added as much water as they suggest, in order to get the sauce to dry out. Perhaps you can add less water and save some time. You need to stir it at least every 5 minutes, scraping the bottom to keep it from burning on. Of course, if you get tired of waiting, or too hungry, you can also eat it "wet."<br /><br />An instant mix is supposed to save time and effort. This one does that, but in truth most of the time in making this dish is waiting for it to cook down to thicken, and you have to do that with the mix version, too.<br /><br />You could use stew beef instead of the expensive steak they suggest. That would be a reason to use the full amount of liquid, then slow-cook to make the beef tender and the sauce thick. After all, curries are really a kind of stew.<br /><br />While this mix calls for beef, rendang is commonly made with chicken and lamb, too. I think the original probably used for tougher beef, and perhaps less choice parts than the tenderloin; the long cooking time makes it more tender. You could even make it vegetarian if you like; it would be good that way too. It normally is not made with pork, at least not in Indonesian or Malaysia, because it is a Muslim recipe.<br /><br />HOW DOES IT TASTE?<br /><br />Very good. Not as good as my Indonesian friend Rosita makes it from scratch, or as good as the ones I've had in Indonesia, but very good. My only complaint is that it is a bit too sweet for my taste. The ingredients list both palm sugar and "sugar", presumably the white kind. I could have done without some of the white sugar; you could taste it and perhaps add some lemon juice. The dish could be spicier, but usually Indonesian food is not that out of the pot; instead they have spicy condiments (sambal) on the table for those who like it hot.<br /><br />The box says to serve it with rice (authentic) or mashed potatoes (not authentic, but sounds like a nice idea).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE<br /><br />4 stars. It's a bit too sweet, in my opinion. And the recipe isn't perfect, such as the odd measurements and a bit too much water.<br /><br />ABOUT ME<br /><br />I am a Vine reviewer and got this mix free for reviewing it. My reviews are my own opinions and are not influenced by getting it for free. I taught a Southeast Asian cooking class for 10 years, and have spent a lot of time all over Southeast Asia studying foods first hand.
