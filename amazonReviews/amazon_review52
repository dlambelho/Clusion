I have six cats and switched to the Blue Buffalo brand six months ago, in June 2010. With six cats--all of varying age, weight and sensitivities--and not being able to afford multiple foods for each of them, it has been extremely difficult to find a single good food that works for them all.<br /><br />In June, I started with Blue Buffalo Spa Select Finicky Feast. All of my cats fell in love with the taste of this food. I was amazed by their improved appearance, energy level and overall health. It was like candy for them but, unfortunately, they ate it quick and my two most sensitive cats were gorging themselves on the food and then throwing it all up before it was digested. With Blue being so pricey I couldn't afford for it to end up in inedible chunks on the kitchen floor.<br /><br />So, I switched to the slightly higher priced Blue Wilderness Duck. Cats being carnivores naturally, this food was amazing as well. It took them a few days to adjust but once they did, their energy level shot through the roof, even higher! While the vomiting problem lessened to about 65% of before, it was still a problem. So, I gathered myself for a long sit at the computer and began researching the various types of Blue cat food all over the net from user reviews such as this one, to blogs about the cats of Blue users and even scientific studies to prove whether Blue Buffalo and other "holistic" pet foods were really all they claimed to be (and worth the high prices).<br /><br />For my research, I considered the varying ages, weights and sensitivities of my six cats. After about two hours of reading, comparing-and-contrasting and even research into other SUPPOSEDLY "good for your cat" foods such as Science Diet and Royal Canin (NOT so good--compare the labels for yourself), the answer to my six very different cats dietary needs was as clear as a bell--Blue Buffalo Longevity Adult. But I was made very quickly upset and disappointed, however, when I discovered that this variety of Blue Buffalo cat food proffers the meats and oils of three fish ( whitefish, menhaden and salmon) as it's primary ingredients. Back in the days when I fed my cats Purina One thinking it was a special "good for your cat" food I discovered that all six of them simply detested fish flavored food of any kind; probably the only dietary issue they had in common.<br /><br />So, I consigned myself to a future of Blue Wilderness Duck with lessened, though nonetheless wasteful and messy, cat vomit on my floors. It was then that I received a blessing in disguise! My car broke down exactly at the same time as I ran out of cat food. I learned that it would be three days before my car was fixed.<br /><br />And so, I had to borrow cat food from my in-laws. Unfortunately, they feed their cats a disgusting and extremely UNHEALTHY dry kibble called "Atta Cat" with ground yellow corn as it's main ingredient. I, and my cats, were devastated. They refused to eat it and went mostly hungry for three days.<br /><br />Finally, my car being fixed after three days, and I rushed out to Petsmart to buy a bag of Blue. I decided that, after three days of going hungry, orange diarrhea and unanimous vomiting I figured that maybe my cats wouldn't mind some healthy AND tasty Blue fish-flavored food. I was very nervous because I knew (or thought I did) how my cats felt about fish. Nevertheless I brought home Blue Longevity Adult and--to my shock and amazement--the three-day fast was completely unnecessary. My six cats went bananas for this food and they all began wolfing it down out of one bowl before the bowl was on the floor! I thought they might just be extra-hungry that day but their enthusiasm for this variety of Blue Buffalo dry food has not lessened a single bit--they love it!<br /><br />Not only do they love it but the vomiting has stopped altogether and my one obese cat has shed pounds and slimmed down to the muscular and energetic cat he used to be and this is a miracle! Not even the other varieties of Blue were able to do that. All of my six cats are healthier than they have EVER been.<br /><br />Let me also note here that after I first switched to the Blue Buffalo brand six months ago, all of my cats grew brand-new lustrous, velvety soft and thick coats of fur and strong, healthy musculature. Their eyes all sparkled and they had so much new-found energy--bouncing off the walls and ceilings--that I was left gasping for breath after playing with them.<br /><br />The switch to Blue Buffalo Longevity Adult has quadrupled these results as well as eliminating hairballs and reducing litter-box mass and odor to nearly zero! This food is so amazing that I almost can't believe it, myself. With all the good protein, healthy fats, antioxidants, omegas, B vitamins as well as a multitude of other vitamins and minerals, whole fruits and vegetables, not to mention Blues cold-formed LifeSource Bits that are like little multi-vitamins in the food, my cats are eating better than my husband and I and I can't help but think it's too good to be true when I see how beautiful, healthy and EAGER to eat their kibble (every morning on the dot) my cats have become.<br /><br />I cannot begin to explain how WORTH THE COST this miraculous food is. It helps overweight and oversensitive cats shed pounds and fight allergies as well as helping overly-skinny cats gain muscle mass and healthy-weighted cats to maintain--I've seen it all with my own eyes. If you have a multi-cat household and are looking for an GOOD, wholesome food that caters to them all, individually and as a group, you must try Blue Buffalo Longevity. If you love your cat or cats, you must switch to the Blue Buffalo brand. I promise--you will NOT be disappointed but delighted day in and day out with your new super-kitty!<br /><br />Go to [...] to receive a $3.00 off coupon on your first purchase of Blue Buffalo cat food.
