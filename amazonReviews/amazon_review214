As futile as it seemed, having a picky eater (step-grandson), came across this Pepperidge Farms Goldfish Bread; no matter how many times his parents have tried to get him to eat a sandwich, it was futile. Always wanting junk food, but I remembered how he loved <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO5Y5M">Nutella Hazelnut Spread, 13-Ounce Plastic Jar (Pack of 5)</a> Nutello when I was very ill; thinking it was peanut-butter and chocolate and learned it wasn't and liked it, but only with very salty crackers. One day, at a local grocery store (Now I know they have it here on Amazon, I am going to snatch them) I saw these and snatched it; but never saw them again.<br /><br />My step-grandson's eyeballs nearly fell out the moment he saw these huge Goldfish ...<br /><br />"Grandma, what is that? A big cracker?"<br /><br />"Son, you will see in a little bit. It's for lunch."<br /><br />(pulling out the Nutello)<br /><br />"Grandma, Goldfish don't come in bread, 'cause I not gonna eat i!"<br /><br />"How can you say that before it hasn't even hit the table yet."<br /><br />"'Cause I hate bread!"<br /><br />"Just wait and see..."<br /><br />"Not gonna eat it. Not hungry."<br /><br />Went ahead and made his and my granddaughter's and all he did was watch his half sister giggle<br />with delight, pointing saying "Eye" "Nose" "Mouff" (Mouth) and then "tail" and was swinging it<br />around like a Goldfish swimming while eating and laughing. Step-grandson constantly looks, his<br />is still on the table sitting there; then suddenly my elderly cat is somewhat curious starts to<br />get close and *zoooooooooooom* he was at his place and pushed her away and said "GO AWAY, MY FOOD!"<br /><br />Next thing you knew, he was also eating and laughing, even poking holes to make his eyes bigger; ate<br />the whole danged thing and even he was a mess himself where poor Grandma had 2 grandchildren to wash<br />up and clean and he turns around to ask me if he could have another one?<br /><br />"No you can't have another one, you hate bread, remember."<br /><br />"No Grandma, I don't hate bread."<br /><br />"Yes you do."<br /><br />"I do not! I like Goldfish! Goldfish isn't bread!"<br /><br />"Ok, if it wasn't bread then what was it then?"<br /><br />"Goldfish."<br /><br />:-/<br /><br />----------------------<br /><br />While I had Ham, Lettuce (Spring Mix), Cheese and Tomatoes with<br />easy Mayo and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00110FILY">Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard, 10-Ounce Squeeze Bottles (Pack of 12)</a> with<br />Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard; holding it from the tail end reduced the<br />slippage of the lettuce and tomatoes which is frequent with traditional<br />loaf bread and yet, wasn't a PITA bread but resembled like one in its<br />appearance - after glancing at it; it looked something what I would<br />present for a Woman's Luncheon for a "Fun Twist". Then I thought<br />about the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P7T7YY">Pepperidge Farm Goldfish Snack Crackers, Made with Whole Grain,Cheddar, 30-Ounces Carton</a><br />which could be used as salad for a GOLDFISH Luncheon. A Nice table<br />decor would be easy to get a bowl and a live golfish swimming around<br />for an added charm. And even using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SFCB9S">Gamago Cold Fish Ice Cube Tray</a><br />Goldfish Icecubes which are filled with Fruit Punch, like this link:<br /><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003ZRZNMA">Hawaiian Punch Fruit Juicy Red, 32-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 12)</a><br />and in glass or Rootbeer mugs (if you have them), add a scoop of<br />vanilla ice cream or two, then add <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003WEHTB4">Shasta Lime Lemon Twist Soda, 12-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a><br />or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003PD2BNI">Sprite Lemon-Lime Soda - 32/12oz</a> and toss in the<br />Goldfish Fruit Punch Ice Cubes and pour in a little Fruit Punch<br />and the Goldfish will be the life and talk of the party. You'll<br />know you'll have a "Blast" as they will gobble it all up, hook,<br />line, and sinker ... except for the live goldfish if you elect<br />for a "Door Drawing" then there's something "fishy" going on.<br />You can always tell them to dress up as if they were going to<br />the Caribbean or Hawaii but keep it a secret as what it is all<br />about and just say "There's just something fishy going on..."<br /><br />Just a thought there!<br /><br />Got to love Pepperidge Farms and this would be AWESOME for not just<br />Office Parties to Red Hat Society Parties; it can even be used for<br />Fund Raising events as well ... and why not for gala events as well?<br /><br />What a tremendous and awesome idea this is! I can't wait to place<br />my orders on getting these breads again! Trust me, they are worth<br />every penny you have!
