The fact that you are reading this review indicates that you are interested in olive oils that are a cut above the olive oil you are likely to find at a supermarket or a corner grocery store (unless you live in an Italian neighborhood).  You probably know, then, that olive trees do not tolerate frost well, so European olive oils come from southern Europe, from near the Mediterranean Sea, where frosts are infrequent.  You probably also know that the most highly regarded oils come from just south of the frost line, in the northern parts of that olive-growing region.  Finally, you know that top-level Italian olive oils fall into two distinct classes, the light Ligurian oils from near Genoa and the Italian Riviera, and the stronger peppery-finish oils from near Firenze and Perugia, in Tuscany and Umbria.  Within the latter group, some Umbrian oils are especially highly regarded, and the Italian government has established a D.O.P (protected geographical designation), "DOP Umbria," for Umbrian oils that meet the certification criteria.  All DOP Umbria olive oils are good:  there, I've said it.<br /><br />WITHIN the DOP Umbria designation, however, there are further subregions.  Many of us regard the olive oils from "Colli Assisi-Spoleto" to be the best of the DOP Umbria oils.  As its name suggests, the Colli Assisi-Spoleto subregion comprises olive groves growing along the lower slopes of the Apennines between Assisi in the north and Spoleto in the south, which is a fairly limited area; and the very heart of that area is the even smaller region close to the towns of Trevi and Foligno.  Some of the oldest known still-producing olive trees in the world grow in that area.  In fact, centuries ago, when the area was part of the Papal States, ruled by the Vatican, olive oil from Trevi was destined to go only to the Vatican; the Popes of that time wanted the best oil for themselves.<br /><br />Just as wine grapes have varietals:  cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir, etc., so do olives have cultivars.  In Tuscany and Umbria, most of the great olive oils come from three cultivars in particular:  Frantoio, Leccino, and Moraiolo.  Trampetti groves comprise all three cultivars.  However, as palates worldwide have become more sophisticated, demand has grown for 100% Moraiolo olive oils, and Trampetti makes a superb one:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YO8P6I">Trampetti Umbrian Organic Extra Virgin Olive Oil - 17 oz</a>.  By diverting its Moraiolo olives to 100% Moraiolo extra virgin olive oil, Trampetti can get a higher price for that oil by itself that it can get for the same oil included within a blended cultivar product.<br /><br />But that leaves Trampetti's Frantoio and Lecino olives behind, and the importer of Trampetti olive oils, Ritrovo, has been the beneficiary.  Ritrovo imports a Trampetti oil that is made from Trampetti's Frantoio and Leccino cultivar olives, and that is the oil under review here.  The Trampetti olive groves are located right between Trevi and Foligno, in the very heart of the heart of the DOP Umbria region; but the Trampetti-produced olive oil under review does NOT have the "DOP Umbria" certification on its label; I do not know why.  However, this oil does have all of the taste of a top flight DOP Umbria oil.<br /><br />Now, before you get the idea that a Moraiolo-less oil is shabby, be aware that some of the most highly regarded Tuscan -- and Umbrian, including DOP Umbria-certified -- olive oils are made from Frantoio and Leccino olives.  Frantoio and Leccino olives can be the basis for GREAT olive oils.  These are oils that you dip freshly baked bread into to savor the oil's taste almost by itself.  These are oils that -- even without any other ingredients -- can transform a few leaves of fresh spinach into a wonderful salad.  We have seen friends drink these oils straight from a demitasse; they are that good (but if you try it be prepared for the peppery finish in the back of your nose).<br /><br />Among all of the top tier Italian extra virgin olive oils, the Ritrovo (Trampetti) Frantoio/Leccino extra virgin olive oil may be the best bargain.  For instance, if you compare this Ritrovo oil to the first class and excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003QCU9R8">Capezzana Extra Virgin Olive Oil 2010 Harvest 100% Italian 500 ml Bottle</a>, you may find that you actually prefer the Ritrovo to the Capezzana; while it is equally true that you may prefer the Capezzana to the Ritrovo, the two oils very much play in the same league, and your preference either way cannot be sneered at:  degustibus non disputandum est.  But between these two very competitive first-tier olive oils, the Ritrovo is far more economically priced than the Capezzana.<br /><br />But take this as a warning to your pocketbook:  Once you have this Ritrovo olive oil in your kitchen, your consumption of olive oil quite likely will spike; you will start putting this oil on and in everything.  You probably will consume a lot more olive oil with the Ritrovo oil in your kitchen than you ever have done before.  You have been warned!
