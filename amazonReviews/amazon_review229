Wendy Tobler's review pulls out the strong points of this soup.  The tomato flavor is indeed richer because of the butter.  I admire Wendy's courage [risking the soybean gestapo] to mention that, lol. What a joy from heaven it is to have organic, true butter in a soup!<br /><br />[THANK YOU Dr.'s Bruce Fife, Mary Enig, Sally Fallon, and others who have shed light on the dark roots of cholesterol phobia, a phobia pushed since the late 50's, which I immediately dismissed, knowing instinctively, without doubt that for me animal fat, butter, cream, etc., were healthy except when my taste buds and stomach said "no" to them.]<br /><br />I agree with Wendy that the soup is addictive; to me it's addictive in a quiet, good way, which I was pleased to discover.  The simplicity sneaks up gradually, so I can understand those who found these soups more bland than they had anticipated.  I appreciate those opinions, because they prepared me to not expect something seething with saucy spice.<br /><br />Appreciated Wendy's comment about "no struggling to dissolve milk or water into it"... I hadn't thought of that, but it's so true.  At first I thought the amount in the can without water or cream added might not be filling, but it is, absolutely.  Of course I wouldn't be adverse to adding heavy cream, but haven't needed to yet.  Been eating it straight out of the can... microwave heated in a tempered clear-glass bowl... I haven't even added parsley like I do with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EM2PGG">Wolfgang Puck Organic Chicken with Egg Noodles Soup</a>.  Usually I don't even need to add my cherished <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001FA1SOG">Organic Saltine Crackers</a>, though I used to pack tomato soup with loads of saltines.<br /><br />[Now I save the saltines for other soups, cheese, peanut butter, etc., and my precious, DELICIOUS <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001SB8AZC">Wild Planet Sustainably Caught Wild Skipjack Light Tuna</a>.]<br /><br />With that experience of increasing satisfaction, added to the effects of Wendy's "no stir struggle" comment, I'm sold on these non-condensed soups.<br /><br />As noted, if I want to alter Wolfgang's soups I can, but the base is easy and good to work from.  I can't delete from something too rich to begin with, but I can quickly add to it, in varieties of ways.<br /><br />Providing canned goods is a different paradigm than cooking "live" for diners who know that a chef's offerings might be richer or spicier than the general public might prefer.  What's interesting, though, is that chefs are often more about subtle, than they are about sassy... when parlaying flavor.<br /><br />Personality is a separate ingredient, LOL!<br /><br />I bought this tomato first [among Wolfgang's offerings] because I had been having trouble finding any type of canned tomatoes [including organic] which tasted okay to me for making spaghetti sauce or a quick tomato-flavored topping.<br /><br />This soup works great on/in meat loaf. I had quit baking Ketchup on top of meatloaf when I discovered how inimical soy products are to me, along with certain types of additives, especially citric acid.<br /><br />Now, thankfully, I've found <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4KYQ">Annie's Naturals Organic Ketchup</a> YUM, and can alternate the differences in flavors in this soup and ketchup, for cooking or conventional use.<br /><br />I've been gradually stocking up on 100% certified organic products [without soy] from Amazon.  My friends, neighbors, and postmistress are gaining along with me [gaining health and flavor, not weight], because sometimes they get gift samples of what I order here.  I'm not yet strong enough to begin cooking heavily again, and with just one to cook for, I don't use up extra quantities quickly.  I enjoy sharing this type of honestly good food, especially since it's been so long since grocery stores and restaurants had many alternatives which weren't packed overwhelmingly with soy and its accompanying additives and genetic alterations, leaving very few choices [almost none when you consider other how many goods in addition to foods are impregnated with GMO soy] for those who need to avoid soy of any type.<br /><br />I don't want to limit the marketplace to my own preferences and beliefs; I just want choices available for what I need to survive with enough health to WANT to survive.<br /><br />IMO, no one yet knows for sure what "items" provide essential nutrition to humans and which are either "empty" or deadly toxic, so having clear labeling and choices seems a good way to go.  Thankfully for me, Amazon is continuing to develop tremendous varieties of economic choices, in almost any and everything.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon and Wolfgang,<br />Linda Shelnutt
