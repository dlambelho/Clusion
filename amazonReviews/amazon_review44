If you are considering purchasing the David's Signature Jelly Beans, this is a great place to start. This contains 16 different flavors, from bacon (not my favorite) to a lemon so sweet and natural you would think you were on the porch drinking lemonade with your Grandma and Grandpa.<br /><br />David was the original inventor of Jelly Bellies, and when he finally re-entered the competition he worked hard to come up with something even better. In my book, he has done that. While these are pricy, they ARE very true to flavor, and have no artificial flavorings or colorings. Where the jelly belly won our hearts with their intensity, these will win out with their true-to-life flavor. It is as though the originals were made for children, these were made for adults.<br /><br />I understand that these are being introduced into some of the upscale candy stores soon, but for now, the only place near me where I can buy them is, well, Amazon.<br /><br />Here is a rundown of my opinion of the different flavors<br /><br />First Row:<br /><br />Bacon: Too much like a slab of bacon for my taste. Save these for the guys to prove how tough they are.<br /><br />Black cherry: These are NOT cherry, they are black cherry, and rest nicely on the tongue. Mmmmm. Good.<br /><br />Blueberry: These are more the taste of blueberry muffins than blueberries off the vine, at least in my opinion. So I guess I better leave them out of my recipes using real blueberries. If you are a blueberry fan, these will tickle your palate.<br /><br />Coconut: So real tasting I'm surprised you don't have to pound them against a rock to get into them. :-) Actually, I like the way these have a fruity aftertaste.<br /><br />Second Row:<br /><br />Cranberry: I have made my own sauce from fresh, and these don't carry quite as much taste. But for a Jelly Bean, they have a tart cranberry flavor. Definitely a winner.<br /><br />Ginger: These are so real I may have to grate these into the next recipe I have that calls for Ginger. In fact, I may save these and use them as decorations on my home made Gingerbread Men. That is if I don't scarf all of them down ... Ooops too late. Maybe I can buy the pound pack next time.<br /><br />Grape: Are you a fan of grape Koolaid? That's exactly what these remind me of, except my Mom always skimped on the sugar, and the super sweet flavor of these makes one Jelly bean taste as good as a full cup of that powdered stuff. I found myself sticking out my tongue to see if it turned purple!<br /><br />Green Apple: This has a strong "sour apple" flavor, which mellows to sweet as you eat it. Not apple pie, something cleaner. I tried it with the Cranberry and loved the two together.<br /><br />Third Row<br /><br />Himalayan Sea Salt: Ummm, these are salty. And sweet. I'm still trying to decide if I like them plain. I really like them with my Godiva Chocolates, but that might be cheating. You will have to make up your own mind on these.<br /><br />Lemon: Fresh squeezed lemonade ... slightly tart, nicely sweet. Clean tasting. If I could make my lemonade this perfect, I'd be in heaven. Sadly, I no longer live in the citrus belt, so I have to visit family in California to get the fresh stuff. They hit the mark with this flavor.<br /><br />Orange Punch: It is oranges, but I would guess it might have a bit of tangerine mixed in. If you have ever eaten home style candied orange peel, you will recognize this flavor. I think they might have called it orange punch since it doesn't taste like a fresh orange. Like some of the other flavors, it gets more sweet as you eat it.<br /><br />Peach: I have my own Sweet Georgia Peach tree, and these are not as good as a home picked peach ripe and warm from the sun with the juice running down my chin. However, they are peachier than most things I have tried that are peach flavored, and will make do when I can't eat mine fresh. More of a peach smoothie flavor ... but I'm pretty picky about peaches. The best part about these is you don't have to peel them to enjoy them.<br /><br />Fourth Row<br />Pomegranate: After my first bite, I was sure it was real fruit and checked for seeds. Nope, just a jelly bean. This is another right-on flavor.<br /><br />Root Beer: Another area where I am picky ... I had to decide, is it A&W or Mugg? Actually, when I was young and had a job at A&W I used to draw frosty mugs there. This tastes a lot like the fresh drawn A&W with a nice head on top.<br /><br />Strawberry: I'm surprised they included this because it is such an overused flavor. So I sat back and rested, concentrating on the flavor, hearing only the flavor (oops, that's my meditation tape, sorry). These have more of a fresh strawberry taste, just like the ones you would cut to put on top of your angel food cake. In fact, if they had a whipped cream variety, I'm sure they would taste nice together. Not as stong as the Pomegranate, but a nice taste all of their own.<br /><br />Vanilla Bean: Have you ever tasted Vanilla flavoring? Yuch, it tastes nothing like the flavor you are expecting from the aroma. This tastes like what Vanilla Flavoring should taste like. As it got sweeter, I started hearing the cranking of the ice cream maker, and realized that it reminded me of the vanilla ice cream my grandma used to make.<br /><br />Loads of different flavors. These come in a nice box and would make an excellent gift for someone who enjoys the very best.<br /><br />If you are looking for an unusual gift for the man in your life, you might want to consider the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007JBLAMK">David's Signature Beyond Gourmet Jelly Beans Man Mix</a> which includes some wilder flavors along with some of these. They even package the Habanero separately to keep the men safe ...<br /><br />I am grateful to have received this sampler in order to try these out, and am happy to post my opinion of them in a review. These are, indeed, beyond gourmet. (Ends review and sneaks off to eat the rest of these wonderful Jelly Beans).
