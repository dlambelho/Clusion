Delicious and a good value.<br /><br />WHAT IT IS<br />I was at first put off by the description "antipasta".  I've purchased Spanish mixes which were mostly pearl onions and tiny cucumbers---tasty, but not cost-effective for the olives.  I've purchased "Mediterranean" mixes which were bare edible because the flavor was dominated by hot peppers and garlic.  However, this "mix" is almost entirely olives, with some tasty capers, a few garlic cloves, a few slices of bell pepper and some spices.  It is flavorful, but the mild flavoring does not overwhelm the taste of the olives.<br /><br />COMPARISION TO "BYZANTINE COUNTRY OLIVE MIX<br />The similar "Byzantine Country Olive Mix"  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000FAPLS6">Byzantine Country Olive Mix, 5-Pound Bag</a> is about the same product without the capers, garlic, and bell peppers, and larger ratio of green olives (about 50% green with the BCOM, 40% green with the BFOA).  Although I like the green olives better, I like the flavor of the "Byzantine Fresh Olive Antipasto" better, so the choice is is a close call.  (I have subscriptions for both, on alternating months).<br /><br />PACKAGING<br />The packaging (into a heavy plastic bag) apparently consisted of draining the olives and then coating them with olive oil.  Amazon packages the bag (folded in half) in a standard ca 3" x 8" x 12" cardboard box.  The first order I placed (about 9 months ago) arrived with some of the softer olives a bit mashed, but Amazon has been improving packaging.  The plastic bag is now wrapped in large bubble-wrap packaged in a box which is packaged in a larger box.  The improved packaging greatly reduces damage to solf olives.<br /><br />REPACKAGING<br />The olives are very salty, saltier than the "Byzantine Country Olive Mix".  You may be tempted to soak them in plain water to reduce the salt content.  Unless you plan to eat the olives in the next few hours, resist the temptation.  First, you'll leach out too much salt and flavor.  Second, the olives will rot in a few weeks.  Really.<br /><br />MAKING YOUR OWN BRINE<br />I suggest gently but thoroughly rinsing the olives when you receive them, ideally in a bowl of warm-hot water (to cut the excess olive oil).  Then drain and repackage them in your own light brine and white vinegar mix in your own jars, and refrigerate.  The light brine will reduce the saltiness of the olives to an appropriate level in a day or two.  It will take about 5 cups of water, about 1/4 cup (4 tbsp) of salt, and 1/3 cup (6 tbsp) of white vinegar to your taste.  Some people like olives salty, some like them vinegary, so adjust to your preferance.  It is best to use "sea-salt" or pickling salt (if you have any handy), because brine made from regular processed salt can get cloudy.<br /><br />EVALUATION<br />Some of the olives are firm, some are soft---that's simply the nature of a true mix. Most Americans (like myself), raised on pimento-stuffed queen olives think that they don't like soft olives.  Indeed, mushy queen olives are yucky.  However, some types of olives are meant to be soft, and are best soft.  It is an acquired taste, worth acquiring.  The mix includes a large variety of olives, both firm and soft.  It is said that the key to oriental cuisine is variety---a variety of colors, textures, and flavors.  The same is true of an olive mix meant for snacking or as the basis of a light meal.<br /><br />If you eat olives regularly, Amazon's subscription service is worth considering.  I'm signed up for monthly shipments and have recieved 3 shipments so far, with no problems.<br /><br />ADDITIONS<br />The bell peppers go so well that I often slice up another red bell pepper and add it to the mix.  I also often add Cerignola and Queen olives to the mix to increase the variety.  I've never seen "American style" ripe olives in any European olive product (although they probably exist).  What Americans call "black olives" (more accurately ripe ripe olives) are entirely different from the black and brown olives in this mix.  American-style ripe olives (black or green)(both are Queen olives allowed to ripen, but in different ways) are a nice addition to the mix, but are preserved in brine only and so, are best mixed when served for a greater contrast of flavors.  Ripe black olives are found in almost any American grocery.  Ripe green olives (see below) are hard to find outside California.  Unpitted are always more flavorful.  I'm not a great fan of Kalamatra olives (also brine-only olives), but a few are a nice addition to a mix.<br /><br />Recommendation 1:  A half-can of chick-peas, a diced tomato, a half-cup of these mixed olives, all mixed together with a little olive oil is a wonderful, tasty, health, lunch.  Alternatively, I often eat these with a dish of mixed nuts, diced cheeze squares, and apple slices.<br /><br />Recommendation 2:  There is a whole world of olives out their worth exploring.  As just example, Grabers Ripe Green Olives are more different from stuffed queen olives than you can imagine, but are marvelous.  Mild and nutty.  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000P8HPCI">Graber Olives Size 14 7.5 oz. Can</a>
