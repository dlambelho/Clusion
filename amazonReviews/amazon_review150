High Promise, Less Delivery<br />I started growing tomatoes with my AeroGarden about two months ago. I got my first flower a few days ago, the first step towards tomatoes. Unfortunately, the pump on the device stopped working the next day.<br /><br />The FAQ on their web site advises me to open the device, take it apart, and clean the pump. They provide seven (7!) pages of instructions to follow and the process requires the use of a flat head screwdriver, small pliers, butter knife and soap. You also have to provide containers to put the liquid in and find a place for the plants that require their roots to be maintained under water. They claim the cleaning will take 20 to 25 minutes on the first attempt.<br /><br />It actually took about 15 minutes to complete, but then my pump was perfectly clean! The problem was not the pump, the problem was that the root system became so extensive after two months of growing, that the mass of roots blocked the pump intake located at the bottom of the tower.<br /><br />When your pump stops working, I suggest before you go to the bother of taking the pump apart, that you first try trimming the root system around the bottom of the pump tower. That is a MUCH EASER REPAIR compared to taking the whole thing apart. At any rate, I put everything back together, and the pump now works.<br /><br />I have several suggestions for AeroGarden management. Number one suggestion, do something about your NON RESPONSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT. Perhaps they answer the phone, but if you send them an email, don't expect a response. Its been one week since I sent them a question about the pump failure... no response to this date. Email communications is worthless with this company, so if you need help, call them. From what I have read about their phone customer service, you might want to have a few snacks at hand and use a speaker phone so you can do other things while you wait.<br /><br />Number two, I suggest that management learn a bit about a concept called "Maintainability". Its related to designing a product so its easy to maintain. Apparently the pump on these things need to be maintained. A little point that is not mentioned in the sales literature. Having to take the thing apart to get at the pump so you can clean the filter is silly and reflects a lack of design competence. It would be a cinch to design something better this. I hope potential competitors are listening.<br /><br />Number Three, add to your pump failure instructions the fact that the root system could be blocking the water intake at the bottom of the pump tower. If your pump stops working, the first thing you should do is to move the roots away from the bottom of the pump tower. You can trim the bottom of the roots with a scissor if you are careful. If that works, you have just saved yourself a lot of trouble that you did not need to go through.<br /><br />Number Four, the growth feeding tablets are hydroscopic. That means they attract water. Keeping them in the little plastic bag provided will, in time, result in their merging together into a large amorphous mass. Management should provide a more water vapor resistant plastic vile to keep the growth feeding tablets in. Of course, that might cost five cents, so its not likely going to happen. So at the minimum, I suggest that users of the thing supply the necessary vile.<br /><br />In Summary, we have an intriguing product, where little attention has been devoted to maintenance design. We have incomplete instructions with respect to trouble shooting in the event the pump stops working. We have non responsive customer service, so if you do have a problem, and you expect to save your current plants, you are pretty much on your own.<br /><br />By the way, why is this thing called an "Aero" garden? Its a hydroponics garden so it would seem that "Aqua" or "Hydro" or "H2O" garden would be a more appropriate name.<br /><br />Would I recommend it? I bought the device because I wanted to learn more about hydroponics gardening. I expected little, so my expectations were met. Its a thought provoking gadget, but given all of the faults in conjunction with non responsive customer support, I have to rate it more in the un-met promise category... that's two stars. I can't justify higher ratings when you have a company that provides customer service at this level of ineptitude.<br /><br />Additional Info as of August 2008<br />I have tried an additional Cherry tomato crop (see my review of the cherry tomato seed kit).  Based on Amazon seed kit reviews, it appears that about 70% of the tomato seed kit reviews are negative. So its not just me. My second batch of tomato's consists of a few marble sized yellow tomatoes, and NO red tomatoes. I am out of nutrients, and I am not going to pay AeroGrows inflated price for more nutrients. I suggest that the cherry tomato kits have a limited shelf life and that AeroGrow is ignoring that. What else can explain 70% negative reviews under controlled growing conditions? Save your money and don't bother with the Cherry tomatos unless you are willing to throw the dice. I am going to try an herb kit next. If it does not do better, I will probably take the thing apart and redesign it correctly.
