There is a lot of controversy surrounding this dietary supplement. The manufacturer claims that their product is the next best thing to eating fruits and vegetables, and that it picks its fruit and veggies at their peak ripeness, and then they use a proprietary process to reduce them to a powder containing much of the original vitamins and nutrients, while maintaining high bio-availability (which means that your body is able to use and take advantage of the nutrients instead of excreting most of it as waste).<br /><br />Many scientific studies, however, claim to disprove, or have produced conflicting results to, many of the manufacturer's claims about the product (see the "Product Research" section on Juice Plus' Wikipedia page: [...]. It doesn't help that the main product distribution process is through the use of multi-level marketing (aka pyramid scheme), and that many reviewers/commenters giving it 5 stars are also re-sellers of this product who always seem to want to send you to their personal website for more information about the product. FYI: I, personally, have not, do not, and do not plan to sell Juice Plus+.<br /><br />Before I knew any of this information, though, our Lamaze coach recommended it as a convenient way for my pregnant wife to make sure that the fetus (and my wife) would get as many vital nutrients as possible. Of course, nothing compares to eating fresh fruits and vegetables, but it's not always possible to eat as many as JuicePlus claims to contain.<br /><br />I have personally used Juice Plus off and on over the past couple years, and I've found that, when I take it regularly for a couple weeks (morning and night, not all 4 capsules at once), most of the tension in my neck and shoulders disappears, which is amazing. So, what's the main catch? At just over $160 for a 4-month supply (per person), it's not exactly a purchase you shrug off. Until I'm able to find something that is as natural, convenient, and doesn't have all kinds of crazy side-effects, though, I'm sticking with Juice Plus.<br /><br />EDIT - 09-13-2012: So I've taken a lot of heat (and have even been personally attacked in the comments) for referencing Wikipedia information from a couple years ago that indicated that JuicePlus distributors worked under a multi-level marketing arrangement, which functions similarly to a pyramid scheme, but is completely legal. The Wikipedia article has since been amended, and now states: "Juice Plus products are marketed by individual distributors who receive sales commissions ranging from 6% (for enrolling five customers in 30 days) to 14% (for enrolling twenty customers in 30 days)."<br /><br />I also made reference to the many studies that tout the benefits of this product, and that many of the claims in these studies are "disputed by consumer watchdog organizations and governmental agencies as misleading". If you read the comments attached to this review (and my other, almost identical, JuicePlus review), you'll see that these studies are defended in the comments here (most likely by JuicePlus distributors) with almost cult-like enthusiasm. However, here is an interesting tidbit from Wikipedia in regards to these myriad "independent" studies. Discuss: "Of the published peer-reviewed studies on Juice Plus products, the majority were funded and/or authored by the manufacturer, Natural Alternatives International (NAI) or the main distributor, NSA. two were funded by individual Juice Plus distributors; and one was conducted independently."<br /><br />My review above praises the product for reducing tension in my neck and shoulders, but I feel as if I'm paying too much for this benefit. Wikipedia backs this up, referencing studies by the University of Berkley, as well as the Center For Science In The Public Interest, stating "it contains too little fruit and vegetable powder to offer significant clinical benefits, its effects can be attributed to the inclusion of added exogenous vitamins and micronutrients, and it is excessively priced relative to its potential benefits."<br /><br />I mentioned that I had not yet been able to find an inexpensive alternative to JuicePlus that offered the same benefits without any negative effects. However, for the past few months, I've discontinued JuicePlus, and have instead tried a product called JuiceFestiv (available through Amazon, Costco, and other retailers), which is similar to JuicePlus in that it contains powdered fruits and veggies in separate capsules. I've determined that JuiceFestiv offers similar benefits to JuicePlus, but at about 1/2 to 1/4 the cost (I've found the best savings when purchased on sale at Costco). That's right, you can get a 2-month supply of JuiceFestiv for $20 compared to a 1-month supply of JuicePlus for $40.<br /><br />I feel that it's important to take care of your body - you only get one - and that carefully researching and trying different natural supplements is a wise investment of your time and money. In this case, MY OPINION (which is backed up by research) is that JuicePlus is overpriced for the benefits it offers. I encourage everyone to try both JuicePlus and JuiceFestiv for themselves; compare the benefits your body receives, and compare the cost per benefit. You may find differences - nobody's physiology is exactly the same - but it's our differences (even of opinion) that make the world go 'round, right? :)
