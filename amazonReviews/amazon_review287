I am a curry FIEND, if it's curry I almost always like it. My fridge has just about every Mae Ploy I could find at our local store. When I saw the Prima Rendang, I was anxious to try it, as I've made this before from recipes I found online.<br /><br />If I found a restaurant that served this, I would buy it, weekly. It's SO tasty, a nice fresh bright clean tasting curry, flavorful without tasting like it has too much salt or sugary sweetness. It tastes like I ground the spices and made the paste myself, it's THAT fresh. I have never made a curry this good at home before.<br /><br />PRO<br />*Easy to make (see tips below) with a payout that is restaurant-quality. You could serve this to guests and they would want to marry you!<br /><br />*The sauce is generous enough that you could easily feed 4 people or a little more if you put in some extra veggies. I sliced up some green onions and I think peas would be good in it, or some grated radish or even a little potato if that's your thing.<br /><br />*Prep time is very fast<br /><br />*Everything you need for the sauce is in the box<br /><br />*All the spices and chilies are so perfectly balanced, you get a total experience of the curry and not just a few spices standing out more than others. It was honestly hard for me to pick out separate flavors, such was the harmonious balance. If I had to guess what spices were in it, that would be hard to do. Wonderful blend. They are listed on the box as: Chili, galangal, onion, shallot, pandan leaf, garlic, candlenut, ginger, lemon grass, fennel, coriander, cumin, kaffir lime leaf, cloves, turmeric, white pepper, cinnamon. I think they forgot to add "crack" into their list, I'm already jonesing for another bowl of this.<br /><br />CONS<br />*The bits of leaves in the sauce kept interfering with my enjoyment of the dish. I know they are important to impart that fresh bright taste, but I felt like I was chewing my cud. It was like having bits of lawn clippings in my food and was annoying. I think this could be offset by using more veggies than I did.<br /><br />*The coconut powder can be lumpy and grainy, see tips below<br /><br />COOKING TIPS<br /><br />*The sauce thickens quickly and wants to stick to bottom of pan, I'd cook the meat to ALMOST done and then combine with the sauce.<br /><br />*Mix the coconut powder and water together, and then whisk in the paste. My coconut powder was lumpy as heck and left a grainy texture and bits in my gravy. Or, save the coconut powder for another use and just sub in a can of your favorite coconut milk. Eliminate or drastically reduce the water if you do this, try the can of coconut milk first and if you need more moisture add in a little water.<br /><br />*Use coconut oil to cook the meat in, it adds a nice flavor to the sauce.<br /><br />*this makes a LOT of food. Especially if you add more than just meat, you could easily feed over 4 people with it. I froze an extra serving to see how it stood up to the process, and it didn't separate. Package your leftovers into lunches or future dinners<br /><br />NUTRITION INFO: Typically I see coconut powder with sugar of some kind added, but this only lists maltodextrin. The Rendang Paste does have palm sugar and sugar listed in the first few ingredients. Just the box ingredients have 75 grams of carbohydrate, with 45 grams of that coming from sugar. That's a lot of sugar bang for the buck.  The entire box also has 1650 calories, 135 g. of fat, with 105 of that being non-animal saturated fat from the coconut. The entire box also has 3450 mg of sodium. Let's face it though folks, no one is going to sit and eat the entire box. (I know, I tried!)<br /><br />If the sauce weren't grainy from the bits of coconut powder, I would give this a 5-star rating. I would love to see this sold as a paste packet or jar, so that I could use my own coconut milk brand. This curry paste is SO amazing, I would love to be able to buy it by the jar and use it on ribs, burgers, chicken, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE: Using the tips to preblend the coconut powder, my second batch was smooth. This also does work with a can of coconut milk, omit the water. This product is available on Subscribe and Save, and it was so good that I signed up to get regular shipments of it. When I have bad bad food cravings and am tempted to go drive out to get something, now I always have this on hand and it is so satisfying! It's good with chicken, beef, and pork. I haven't tried any other meats. But d*mn, you gotta try this.
