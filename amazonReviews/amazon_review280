It was the packaging that sold us with this <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> when my son and I were online here, looking for some interesting new chili variations. This one seemed different from some of the others, so we bought this pack of three 12oz bags. Not cheap, but it seemed interesting at the time.<br /><br />We unpacked the shipment upon arrival, and found that each one had the following:<br /><br />> One genuine Boot Scootin' burlap bag, with a drawstring (see the user photo)<br />> One miniature bottle of genuine TabascoÂ® green pepper sauce, enough for one person.<br />> Chili Seasonings, containing onions, garlic, salt, black pepper and green chilies<br />> 10 oz. of whole pinto beans<br /><br />The nutritional info states the following: Serving Size 12 oz.

Based on a 2,000 calorie diet.<br /><br />The Product Description was quite unusual, to say the least:<br /><br />"Uncle Charlie jus adds in sum of his real special dried green tabascy plants to het up this chili. Now the boys `round these parts reely lak this chili bettrn the red sissy chili. Most the womens think the green's a little hot fer thur sweet lips."<br /><br />Taste Test:<br /><br />Without all of the boring details, we followed the enclosed directions to the letter, adding ground beef to keep the initial batch as simple as possible. It smelled good as it was cooking, but we had to increase the cooking time, simmering it gently for an extra hour as it was a little flat. Let's just say that it was disappointing, and that's an understatement. For the next attempt, we tried the time tested method of cooking the chili the day before, letting it cool down, then refrigerating the batch overnight to give all the flavors time to blend. That was a very slight improvement, but not by much. Let's just say that it was reminiscent of some chili that I once had at an obscure New Jersey diner that's no longer in business. There never was a third attempt.<br /><br />Sometimes it's just better to do it yourself. This is the recipe that I use for "DIY Slow Cooked Chili" that I learned years ago when living in the South, and the one that I fall back on when in the mood for cooking:<br /><br />* 2 lb. ground beef<br />* 1 1/2 cups chopped onions<br />* 1/2 cup chopped green pepper<br />* 2 garlic cloves, finely cut (not chopped)<br />* 28 oz. can whole tomatoes<br />* 2 (16 oz.) cans kidney beans<br />* 2 tbsp. chili powder<br />* 2 tsp. salt<br />* 2 tsp. cumin<br />* 2 tsp. black pepper<br /><br />Brown the ground beef; add onions, green pepper, garlic, tomatoes, kidney bens, salt, chili powder, pepper and cumin in a slow cooker or crock pot. Cover and simmer on low setting for 6 to 8 hours. Makes 8 to 10 servings. Serve with cornbread and whatever hot sauce you like. Looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008JHROIM">Tabanero Hot Sauce Picante</a>, as it's been highly recommended.<br /><br />Notes:<br /><br />This company also makes <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007680BD0">Redneck Chill E SPICY</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00767OJDO">Redneck Habanerah Allives</a> (you'll just have to look at that one), but to date this reviewer has resisted the temptation to try either of these or their other offerings. However, I did receive a box of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7F8G">Leonard Mountain 3 Amigos Enchilada Stew</a> as a gift from a friend, and this product was easily worth a 5-star recommendation. That was one of the reasons that I tried their chili mix. Go figure.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />Cannot say that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EO7DTC">Leonard Mountain Boot Scootin' Green Chile Chili</a> was the worst chili mix that I've ever had, but it's probably borderline close. What one pays for here is cute slogans and clever packaging, and this product is highly overpriced for what you get. Sad to say, even those chili seasoning packets you find in the spice section of your grocery store are better. But the burlap bag packaging was clever, and my son kept the miniature Tabasco green pepper sauce bottle, so I'll give it one star each for the creative packaging and the tiny Tabasco bottle.<br /><br />9/4/2012
