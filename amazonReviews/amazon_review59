PROS:<br />Added sweetness without the added carbs<br />One of the better tasting stevia-based products for me<br />No effects on insulin levels<br />Safe for diabetics<br />0 calories<br />Moderately priced for a low calorie sweetener<br /><br />CONS:<br />Sweet, but with a different overall taste than sugar<br />Bitter aftertaste better than other stevias I've tried, but still accentuated at higher concentrations<br />Fine grained, non-sugar like powder<br /><br />Zsweet is one of the better stevia based sweetener on the market.  It is moderately priced and a reasonable alternative to table sugar when used to sweeten hot beverages.  The sweetness of this and any other stevia compound is not exactly like table sugar and this one, too, is plagued by the bitter aftertaste that can occur when you use the product at higher concentrations.  Still, Zsweet did a pretty darn good job and is definitely a product that you might want to try.<br /><br />Please note, I have been trying a lot of different sugar substitutes recently.  Instead of making a big investment in yet another sweetener, I ordered sample Zsweet packets from the company's website.  So basically, I looked at this as a coffee or tea sweetener and was more limited in testing, given the number of packets that I was sent.  Still, I think that I was able to fairly assess Zsweet.<br /><br />The packets contain one gram of sweetener.  The powder is finer than table sugar but easily pours and mixes into a beverage.  Each package is supposed to equate to about two teaspoons of sugar.<br /><br />Zsweet's claim to fame is that it is a combination of two different natural sweeteners.  Stevia, which is a leaf extract from stevia rebaudiana and erythritol, a sugar alcohol. According to the company's website the two sweeteners complement each other, yielding a better, hybrid product.<br /><br />In my opinion, however, the erythritol is basically used as a vehicle in the Zsweet packets.  Let me tell you why I say this.  Erythritol on its own does have a very clean, sugar-like taste, but there's not enough erythritol per packet to contribute much to the sweetness (see next paragraph if you want a full explanation). The erythritol is basically used as a filler.  Stevia is something like 300 times more potent than sugar.  Purified, you'd only need less than a few 100ths of a gram of stevia to equal two teaspoons of sugar.  Erythritol adds bulk without interfering with the stevia.  Note, that in their baking product(e.g. Zsweet granulated), where you need added bulk--the company probably uses more erythritol (and possibly fillers like polydextrose, I'm not certain) so that you can measure out Zsweet granulated as you would sugar.<br /><br />(For the mathematically inclined--others may want to pass on this--Erythritol is only about 70% as sweet as sugar.  Zsweet packets are supposed to be about as sweet as two teaspoons of sugar.  Two teaspoon of sugar equates to 8 grams.  In order to get the same relative sweetness of sugar, you would need about 11.4 grams of erythritol.  Given that the packets are only about 1 gram apiece, this would be the equivalent of 0.7 grams of sugar or just about 1/6 of a teaspoon of sugar--not enough to appreciably sweeten.)<br /><br />So the major ingredient that sweetens here is stevia.  Zsweet's stevia, as with all stevia preparations, has two main difficulties.  First, the sweetness of the stevia is more cotton-candy like.  Although this is a pleasant taste, it is not quite the same as sugar.  I preferred the taste in flavored teas (e.g. raspberry) where the stevia taste complemented the fruitiness of the beverage.  However, I was less enamored of the taste in coffee, where I prefer a more generic sweet taste like plain table sugar.<br /><br />The second problem with stevia is the bitter, almost licorice-like, aftertaste.  This was less pronounced at lower concentrations of the Zsweet, but if you up the amount of sweetener the bitterness does kick in.  Once again, Zsweet worked better in the tea, where its taste enhanced the natural sweetness of the raspberry flavor.  Because of this, I tended to use less Zsweet in the tea and the bitter aftertaste was barely noticeable.  In coffee, however, the results were less impressive.  I don't like my coffee overly sweet, usually one to two teaspoons of sugar per ten ounces.  (For comparison's sake, this is about ½ pack of Equal sweetener.)  One pack of Zsweet didn't quite cut it for my coffee.  A packet and ½ worked fine in terms of sweetness, but then that bitter aftertaste kicked in a bit.  Not as overwhelming as I have experienced with some other stevia brands, but it was still there.<br /><br />(A word to the wise: the bitterness is pronounced at high concentrations.  If you try to taste a stevia preparation straight out of the packet and directly onto your tongue, you will conclude that it is bitter beyond belief and never use it as a sweetener--this is true of Zsweet and any other stevia preparation I have tried.  However, the bitterness fades more or less when you dilute the stevia in a larger volume. Depending on the preparation/brand, the bitterness fades to a varying degree and the sweetness comes out at lower concentrations.  Always test stevia in a diluted form.)<br /><br />The quality of the sweetness and bitterness of stevia preparations really varies from brand to brand.  I still haven't found the ideal stevia:  all of them don't sit quite well on my palette.  Everyone's taste buds are different, though, so you have to see what your preferences are.  I will say that this one of the better stevias that I have tasted and is eminently usable.  I would definitely use it in tea, but not for my morning coffee.<br /><br />Having a choice, however, I prefer pure erythritol and xylitol in terms of flavor.  These sweeteners certainly have limitations of their own but are far more similar in taste to table sugar and don't come with a bitter aftertaste.
