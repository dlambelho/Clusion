I just bought the same 10 pound box for 17.88 at the local Home Depot.<br /><br />I've been using the granular Miracle Grow for 30 years or so.  It works well.  You can expect most plants to show improvement after about 10 days.<br /><br />COMPARISON TO MIRACLE GROW LIQUID FERTILIER.<br />As others have noted regarding the soluble fertilizer feeder, it is erratic.  If you don't empty the container and allow it to dry after every use, it can clog up internally and will cease to deliver fertilizer.  The Liquid Miracle Grow system has exactly the same problems (in my experience, worse), and is the fertilizer is more expensive.<br /><br />OTHER CONCERNS<br />Sometimes you get a bright blue stream and a few seconds later a colorless stream (presumably containing less fertilizer.  After a few minutes of watering, the solution is considerably less blue---but it is probably just as rich in fertilizer as long as there is a tablespoon or so of undesolved fertilizer in the container.  The blue pigment is more soluble, but is probably not an essential component of the fertilizer.<br /><br />TIPS ON USE:<br />Fill about half (not more than half) the container with water.  Pour in the dry fertilizer---much of it will dissolve instantly as it hits the water, making room for the rest of the bag.  Add water as necessary to fill the container.  Screw the sprayer onto the container.  Shake (and turn upside down) to mix.  The first several minutes will be very rich, so use it where you need the most fertilizer.  Swirl the container occassionally as you water to encourage the undesolved fertilizer to dissolve.  Concentrate on spraying the leaves, not the soil---the soil will get enough dripping from the leaves.<br /><br />When there gets to be only a teaspoon of undesolved fertilizer in the container, consider it "used up".  You can continue to water, but don't assume that you are applying fertilizer.  When you are nearly done, turn the container upside down.  That will empty the container, including any undesolved fertilizer, so the fertilizer stream can be rich, so spray it where it is needed.  Water with the container upside down for 30 seconds or so after the container is empty to rinse out the internal passageways.  Ideally, you should take the sprayer off the hose, and open it so that the sprayer and container and dry out fully.<br /><br />FEEDING SCHEDULE<br />A good soaking will provide your plants with all the nutrients they need for a 2-week growth spirt.  Beware though that the solubility of Miracle Grow is a mixed-blesssing, if you feed your garden in the morning, an afternoon shower can wash all the Miracle Grow away before your plants have a chance to absorb most of the nutrients.  So, I suggest using Miracle Grow at least once-a-week in the spring when your plants are growing rapidly.  Later in the summer, when growth slows and rain is frequent, reduce the feeding schedule to one every two to four weeks.  Toward the Fall, a maintenance feeding once a month may be advisable.  Most professional gardeners discourage Fall feeding, on the theory that dormancy should be encouraged to avoid frost damage.  Depending on your situation, your feeding schedule might be different.  Here in tropical South Florida, the dry season sets-in in the Fall and the plants come out of their Summer torpor, so that's when I step-up my feeding schedule.  If your Springs are cool and misty---once every two weeks may be adequate. In the northeastern States, I suspect that weekly feeding all Summer long would be desirable.<br /><br />FOLIAR FEEDING<br />Part of the whole point of Miracle Grow is foliar feeding---that plants will absorb nutrients through their leaves faster than via their roots---but the leaves can only absorb a little at a time.  So foliar feeding needs to be light and frequent.  Light frequent foliar feeding (even daily) is most effective in which it rains frequently during the growing season, washing nutrients out of the upper soil layer.  Orchids are best feed sprayed daily with a weak foliar solution.<br /><br />DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS FOR DIFFERENT PROBLEMS<br />Despite all the shortcomings of Miracle-grow feeders, they remain the best solution for fertilizing home vegetable or flower gardens.  Trees, hedges, and lawns are best feed inexpensive dry granular 10-10-10 fertilizer, well watered in.  Orchids and delicate indoor flowers are best sprayed (with a pump-up or squeeze bottle sprayer) with a weak solution (1 teaspoon/gallon) of liquid Miracle Grow.  New plants are best started with slow-release fertilizer pellets mixed in with the soil.
