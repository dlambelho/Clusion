1. Does not have USDA Organic stamp and no organic certification. YS Organic Farms is the name of the producer,<br />2. Does not specify 100%,<br />3. Does not come in glass jar, organic comes in glass jar.<br /><br />This Honey deserves ***** 5 stars but the seller zero for misrepresentation. YS Farms raw honey is a very good raw honey, very good tasting and I have consumed many jars of the YS Farm raw honey but this is not an organic raw honey, it is conventional regardless how good it tastes. It is good enough that I just ordered few jars of this from Vitamin Shoppe since they were selling it for $5.91 a jar. I consume the organic one as well. The labeling on the jar is specified as Y.S. ECO BEE FARMS. There is no misrepresentation by the YS, it is by the sellers including Amazon where they specify as organic just to boost their sells but then after busted they close that chapter or correct the disclaimer. Apparently Monsanto recently contributed $4.2 million to defeat the ballot measure scheduled for California voters on November 6, 2012, proposition 37, along with DuPont, Bayer, BASF, Syngenta, and other biotech companies that have each contributed over a million dollars each in their attempt to keep us the consumer in the dark about GMOs in our food. YS Farms sells 100% organic honey with certification and USDA stamp for more money. Consumers like LIZABETH have chosen to make misleading comments. For LIZABETH to discredit USDA, organic certification process, as well as YS Farms when YS Farms sells the organic honey, and then define a non organic honey as "some of the best organic raw honey out there" is appalling. Hopefully consumers will get the chance to read the facts and educate themselves accordingly and organic farmers will keep producing organic produce for individuals who actually want organic instead of conventional, regardless of LIZABETH's misleading comments and explanations.<br /><br />Some of the best organic raw honey out there!, April 22, 2012<br />By Lizabeth (BARTLESVILLE, OK, United States)<br />Our very favorite raw honey comes from All About Bees in Ralston, NE but this honey is a very, very close second. I resorted to bringing in honey from afar when I no longer had access to our favorite. I wanted to buy honey locally and everybody says theirs is "raw" but it isn't unless it is cloudy and a bit gritty like this one is (those are good qualities, I promise!). My kids quickly came to enjoy this texture and taste as their favorite. The clear stuff is too cloyingly sweet. Anyway, I will be using this as the honey for my family and the 3 pound size here on Amazon with Prime is a great deal when they can keep it in stock!<br /><br />Sep 4, 2012 6:09:55 PM PDT Lizabeth says:<br />I appreciate you notifying me of your concerns. However, until they can put a leash on bees, I don't trust ANY organic labeling for honey! My review is based on reputation, taste, and comparison to my favorite raw honey in addition to many, many years of raw honey consumption. Organically certified honey from Canada from purportedly pesticide free regions tastes exactly the same to me - I have purchased them both and based my recommendation on my personal opinion and rated it accordingly.<br /><br />THIS IS NOT SOME OF THE BEST RAW HONEY OUT THERE SINCE IT IS A CONVENTIONAL HONEY NOT AN ORGANIC HONEY, BUT IT IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE BEST CONVENTIONAL RAW HONEY OUT THERE. SHAME ON CONSUMERS AND SELLERS WHO MISREPRESENT AND MISGUIDE PUBLIC FOR THEIR OWN SELFISH AND FINANCIAL GAIN.<br /><br />I consume honey all the time since it has many nutritional benefits for me. I consume after any meal since it helps digestion. I used to consume chocolate years ago but I do not anymore since I consume pure cocoa in my power drinks. I am into many sports and quality honey is the best low calorie energy I can get to boost my immune system and give me healthy energy when I am middle of my mountain biking, hiking, backpacking, surfing, etc. I drink lots of tea and I never use honey instead I use molasses. Molasses does not lose its nutrition when heated but any further heat to raw honey kills the quality enzymes and pollens in honey so I only consume honey straight out of the jar with spoon. This is a superfood to me only when it is from quality producers, in a raw stage, and not mixing it with hot drinks in moderation. Honey is the best ointment for all my scabs in mountain biking trails. After a day when my wounds are sealed I place raw honey for rejuvenation and it is the best healer of all instead of using Neosporin which loosens the scab and removes the scab, leaving scars on my skin. Bravo.
