When I run out of these, I don't buy whatever more conveniently available brand happens to be a 5-minute drive away.  No other instant noodles product compares to this, & I'll wait however long it takes to stock up again with this specific product, & regardless of how relatively inconvenient the access is for me to obtain this from the vendor who has stocked this product for the entire time I've been purchasing it, & enjoying it.<br /><br />With that being said, I have a definite affinity for the Pork flavor of this product, as well -- but when I stock up, I purchase both, & it doesn't end up being a 50-50 split.<br /><br />The taste of this product is unique, & the 'spice factor' is such that there is definitely a 'kick' (when I was a kid, I used to wonder how a close relative of mine could 'stand' spicy foods, especially when it made him sweat & sniffle -- well, now I 'get' it ;) ).<br /><br />It's worth noting that if one wishes to manipulate the spice intensity, making a more dilute soup will result in relatively less 'kick' -- however, one can pretty much count on experiencing 'something', spice-wise, with this, even if only in a ~cumulative sense (for me, as I work my way through a serving of this, there is less & less time between any given spoonful's ingestion & its spice-based 'impact' -- & I don't make it through an entire serving without having my nose start to run [a consequence/'side effect' I am willing to endure, given that it 'goes with the territory' of doing a tango with the spices that contribute to this flavor's amazing taste]).<br /><br />In addition to the taste of this being so interesting (& practically crave-inducing at times, if I haven't eaten it in a while), it makes for one of the only liquid-based anything -type of food item for which I ever use cauliflower -- the cauliflower ends up being infused with the spice-&-flavored liquid base, which results in it not only 'looking pretty', but also having a taste that meshes well with its having-been-cooked-with-the-noodles softened texture (I made this [& simply called it 'Thai noodles with cauliflower'] for a few relatives, who were hesitant when it came to instant noodles, but they loved it, & they loved how flavorful the cauliflower was).<br /><br />For years, the Mama brand of noodles, & the wonderful spice packets associated with the Tom Yum & Pork flavors, have provided me with the 'base' for a filling meal that includes a decent amount of specific vegetables being placed in with the noodles while they cook (often, I'll make 2 noodle packets at a time) -- & importantly, on many such occasions, involves vegetables that I simply do not make or eat at any other time (such as baby kohlrabi) -- the flavor of the Tom Yum & Pork varieties ends up making such meals a kind of 'vegetable & noodle party in a bowl', & infuses certain vegetables with the relevant Mama flavor in a way that ought to have both of the individual 'participants' high-fiving one another (that is, if vegetables & noodles could high-five anything :) ).<br /><br />I don't have a wide range of vegetables that I 'go to' for inclusion with the Mama Tom Yum & Pork flavor instant noodles -- it's basically restricted to the following (with one of more added on any given Mama-noodles-as-a-meal occasion) -- sliced baby carrots (the most frequent vegetable 'guest' [I usually halve or quarter the baby carrots (a size/thickness that allows for their cooking sufficiently during the relevant timeframe [I tend to place the carrots in first, to cook in the liquid until the water comes to a boil (the carrots then finish cooking during the brief time associated with the noodles cooking)])])... thin slices of celery (another vegetable that can readily absorb the Mama flavoring liquid base)... pieces of torn lettuce (not something I would have thought of on my own -- a Thai friend included lettuce when preparing some Mama noodles years ago, & I've done so on many occasions since -- the lettuce absorbs the flavor, & adds an interesting texture to each biteful of noodles [it's also an easy way to take in a 'small salad', so to speak (honestly, overall, this is one of my favorite ways to ingest vegetables -- via 'Mama transport' :) )])... Chinese Napa cabbage (this is stiffer than lettuce, has a pretty look to it, & is also something which I only eat when cooked with Mama noodles)... cauliflower (with Tom Yum flavor only, & cauliflower being cooked in the water before ultimately adding the noodles)... baby kohlrabi (sliced & then at times cut further / the dark green of this vegetable [as well as the light green of Napa cabbage], when combined with the orange of the sliced baby carrots, ends up making for a very colorful, & 'pretty' dish)... frozen sweet peas (added to the water before bringing it to a boil / is also a colorful component, & makes for a 'pretty' look to the resulting meal)... & at times, I've added uncooked spinach leaves (to the water before adding the noodles / this is also an easy way to take in a decent amount of spinach).<br /><br />The Mama Tom Yum spices can have your tongue begging for mercy at times, & have your sinuses thinking they've just had a sauna installed, but all in all, 'it's all good'... :)<br /><br />I love the Mama Tom Yum noodles, have been eating them for over 20 years now, & can honestly say I've never tasted anything like it.  The flavor is fantastic, interesting, & as I've found, if you go long enough without eating it, you'll end up missing it, & find yourself on the mop-side of the Swiffer commercials, with 'Baby Come Back' being played as the theme song... :)
