They aren't understanding that the vanilla flavor is *supposed* to be subtle.  If you don't believe me, just read the bag because it states this quite clearly.  I've seen many reviews where the reviewer is dinging the rating because the flavor is subtle and that's not fair in my opinion because that's what Starbucks is trying to accomplish.  And for those who say that there is no vanilla flavor, I strongly disagree.  It's there but it's subtle, which is the entire idea here folks.<br /><br />Along those same likes, I thought I'd compare the subtle flavors of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee to the more pronounced flavors of the Melitta Pariaian Vanilla coffee.  So I brewed two cups and then sampled each side-by-side.  Following are my impressions of each coffee.<br /><br />Cost: While prices change all of the time, as of this writing, Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.59 per ounce.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla Coffee is selling for $0.58 per ounce.  So in essence, the price is roughly the same between the two.<br /><br />Color/Roast: The color looks about the same between the two.  It's a medium roast or roughly a city roast for those who know what that means.  In the past I've felt as if Starbucks overroasts some of their coffee.  Fortunately, that does not appear to be the case with their Natural Vanilla Coffee.<br /><br />Grind: The grind is also about the same.  Melitta calls it an extra fine grind but both are probably somewhere between a fine grind and an extra fine grind.  I brewed both cups in my Jura S7 espresso machine in the Cafe Americano style, which is basically hot water added to a shot or two of espresso.<br /><br />Aroma in the bag: Starbucks mostly smells like very good quality coffee.  The scent of vanilla is present but subtle.  What vanilla scent is there is reminds one of  fresh and natural ingredients.  The Melitta has more of a pronounced vanilla scent.  The Melitta's scent is pleasant but slightly artificial to my nose.<br /><br />Aroma in the cup: The vanilla scent is very subtle with respect to Starbucks Natural Vanilla.  The Melitta Parisian Vanilla has a stronger, but not overpowering scent.  There's more vanilla scent in the Melitta cup to be sure.<br /><br />Flavor: Both coffees are very pleasant, although I'd characterize Starbucks Natural Vanilla as being a very good quality coffee with a subtle hint of vanilla versus Melitta's Parisian Vanilla coffee being a vanilla-flavored coffee, if that makes sense.  While I still like and recommend the Melitta, I think I like it a little bit less now that I've tried the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Coffee.  That's because the Starbucks brew has a fresher and more natural aroma and flavor.  But again, the Starbucks coffee is far more subtle than the Melitta coffee.  For some, that will be a good thing and others will undoubtedly wish for a more forward vanilla flavor.<br /><br />Ingredients: The Starbucks Natural Vanilla lists their ingredients as "Ground Coffee, Natural Flavors, Ground Vanilla Beans & Indian Sarsaparilla Root" (with Corn Maltodextrin & Vegetable Glycerin added).  Melitta doesn't tell you what's in their blend.  I visited Melitta's website in an effort to determine what sort of ingredients are used to flavor their Parisian Vanilla.  They use words like "rich" and "smooth and creamy", but nothing more specific that I could find.  So I am going to assume that Starbucks uses ingredients that I would consider to be of a superior quality to the ingredients used to flavor the Melitta Parisian Vanilla.<br /><br />Recommendations: One thing that I like to do is to buy non-flavored beans and simply add a teaspoon or tablespoon of fresh vanilla to a cup of non-flavored beans.  So this is also an option.  If you go this route, use only real vanilla and not the artificial stuff.  Now with respect to these flavored coffees, they're both very good.  Tasting the two coffees side-by-side gave me a good opportunity to compare the two.  While I still like the Melitta Parisian Vanilla, I prefer the subtle character and fresh ingredients of the Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla coffee.  If you prefer a coffee with a more pronounced but not overpowering vanilla flavor, go with Melitta.  If you prefer a well-balanced coffee with a subtle but fresh and natural vanilla flavor, you might prefer the Starbucks version.  If you're not sure, consider trying each and decide for yourself, as they're not terribly expensive.  But in the end, I do think that they are both very good.
