East Cape Manuka Honey is incredible! It's fantastic for a variety of uses: 1) a spoonful approx. 20 minutes before meals seems to drastically reduce the chances of suffering gastro-intestinal distress (such as from IBS or other upset); 2) I haven't been sick with any colds or flu since consuming one or more spoonfuls a day even when repeatedly exposed to sick friends, family and co-workers so I believe it boosts the immune system; 3) as a facial or spot treatment vs. acne (adult or teenager), this honey rapidly speeds healing of existing acne and prevention of future outbreaks; it also leaves my skin smooth and tight; 4) as a rapid wound healer, there is nothing better I've found in nature or science. For me, it works faster and better than any OTC antibacterial cream, from reducing pain signals to promoting actual healing. One tiny 2.5 oz. jar lasts me about 4-6 weeks of conservative daily use. The honey has a smoky, somewhat medicinal flavor that isn't very good but isn't bad, either. You get used to it. After all, the results are worth it!<br /><br />Be warned, not all honeys are created equal. Only New Zealand Manuka Honey with a UMF rating is legit because it is tested and certified by the New Zealand government to have the correct "Unique Manuka Factor" rating and purity. The reason New Zealand Manuka Honey is so powerful is the bees feast on the New Zealand Manuka tea tree plant (which is ten times more powerful than its Australian cousin). This results in their honey being loaded with antibacterial properties! Because Manuka Honey is rare and expensive, a large number of fakes are available that claim to be "bio-active" or "UMF equivalent" to whatever UMF number (12+, 15+, etc.). These knock-offs do contain some Manuka Honey but are not 100% pure; they are cut with other honeys which make it cheaper to produce and less effective. Yet many will charge the same price as the real deal for this inferior product hoping customers won't know the difference! I've tested regular store-bought American honey vs. a "bio-active 15+" knock-off Manuka Honey vs. the "real deal": East Cape Manuka Honey UMF 20+. The American honey had minor benefits, the knock-off Manuka brand offered a clear improvement (2-3 times better than American honey) but was still not strong enough. However, the East Cape UMF 20+ gave me results that were right off the chart! I won't settle for anything less now.<br /><br />To combat acne: You should wash first with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V96R1G">Manuka Honey Propolis Soap</a>. Apply the honey directly as a spot treatment or all over as a mask once or twice daily and leave on for 30-60 minutes, then wash off with cold water.<br /><br />When I first began using Manuka Honey, I had quick results but like anything, you have to stick with it or the acne comes back. If the honey doesn't get rid of your acne completely (like me, although it did do an amazing job of reducing it), you should also try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0011DI8K4">Manuka Oil 100% Pure East Cape 10ml/0.34oz</a> (again, you should wash first with <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V96R1G">Manuka Honey Propolis Soap</a>), maybe alternating between the oil and the honey masks once each per day (whatever combination works best for you). The oil is even stronger and more concentrated than the honey; some people may find it too strong when applied directly. If this is you, then you can try 2-3 drops diluted in a solution of water and/or witch hazel. The oil is also handy for healing minor wounds like hangnails, paper cuts or cat scratches; I place a drop directly on the wound several times a day and it works like a charm. The only downside to the oil is it has a strong medicinal odor (not awful but not good) so I wouldn't use it right before leaving the house or inviting friends over. It might also sting a little when it first goes on but this should vanish within a few minutes.<br /><br />Note that the higher the UMF rating, the stronger the antibacterial properties. For therapeutic uses such as mentioned above, I wouldn't go with less than UMF 15+ but prefer 20+. Natural Solutions/East Cape makes both and there are other brands that are also UMF-certified but I haven't tried them. All of my Manuka orders have been through Koru Naturals and they have been lightning fast to ship and quick to respond to emails (they've also securely packed my honey each time to avoid breakage in transit). Koru also offers a nice selection of other healthcare items from New Zealand (lanolin, etc.).<br /><br />One final word: I'm not a doctor. I'm not offering medical advice. Different sites offer different treatment suggestions (which I encourage you to read and consider before use). I can't guarantee Manuka will work miracles for you but I know it did for me! Both my MD and naturopath proved  useless in diagnosing or treating my skin problems; problems that had plagued me for nine years. Only Manuka proved effective and I'd tried everything from prescription drugs to diet changes. Your results may vary but if you suffer from any of the problems I've mentioned above and nothing else has worked, you owe it to yourself to at least try Manuka. It changed my life!
