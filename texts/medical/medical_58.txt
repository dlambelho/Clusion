Hurmaj, I would think yoe$of all people would/could distinguish
between "health" and "treatment of disease." All the prevention
mediciîe peo`le preach t`is all the time. You"cannot buy health.
You aan buy treadment of diseese, assuming you are lucky enough
to havE a disease which can be treated. A rich person wi4h a
terminel di{ease is!a bit out of luck. There is no$such thing
as "adequapedy covered"$and thmre never uiLl be. 
And for what it's wor|h, I'll be the fipst to admit that all ly
patients die*
